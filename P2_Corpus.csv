(2013),2013,A quantum access network,Nature,10.1038/NATURE12493,"The theoretically proven security of quantum key distribution (QKD) could revolutionize the way in which information exchange is protected in the future. Several field tests of QKD have proven it to be a reliable technology for cryptographic key exchange and have demonstrated nodal networks of point-to-point links. However, until now no convincing answer has been given to the question of how to extend the scope of QKD beyond niche applications in dedicated high security networks. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate the concept of a 'quantum access network': based on simple and cost-effective telecommunication technologies, the scheme can greatly expand the number of users in quantum networks and therefore vastly broaden their appeal. We show that a high-speed single-photon detector positioned at a network node can be shared between up to 64 users for exchanging secret keys with the node, thereby significantly reducing the hardware requirements for each user added to the network. This point-to-multipoint architecture removes one of the main obstacles restricting the widespread application of QKD. It presents a viable method for realizing multi-user QKD networks with efficient use of resources, and brings QKD closer to becoming a widespread technology.",,Article,6,0.829578876,0.137955362,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.093175451,0,0,0,0.115888439,0.138901752,0.167312523,0.04044702,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.181637871,0,0,0,0,0.073813602,0.090818936,0,0,0.12748034,0,0,0.037276101,0,0.114183074,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.086802428,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.131659975,0,0,0,0,0.087960499,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.098239158,0,0.109930707,0.109810813,0.141324064,0,0,0,0,0.212437732,0,0.164275615,0.102402552,0,0.279228671,0,0.096903579,0,0,0,0,0,0.139379689,0.734330991,0.132526063,0,0,0,3.946103007,0.547815042

Multiple photonic degrees of freedom have been explored to generate high-dimensional quantum states, both with bulk optics and integrated photonics. Furthermore, these quantum states have been propagated through various channels, \textit{e.g.} free-space links, single-mode, multicore, and multimode fibers and also aquatic channels, experimentally demonstrating the theoretical advantages over two-dimensional systems.

5,3,C3,Sevilla & Riedel (2020),2020,Forecasting timelines of quantum computing,arXiv: Quantum Physics,(missing DOI),"We consider how to forecast progress in the domain of quantum computing. For this purpose we collect a dataset of quantum computer systems to date, scored on their physical qubits and gate error rate, and we define an index combining both metrics, the generalized logical qubit. We study the relationship between physical qubits and gate error rate, and tentatively conclude that they are positively correlated (albeit with some room for doubt), indicating a frontier of development that trades-off between them. We also apply a log-linear regression on the metrics to provide a tentative upper bound on how much progress can be expected over time. Within the (generally optimistic) assumptions of our model, including the key assumption that exponential progress in qubit count and gate fidelity will continue, we estimate that that proof-of-concept fault-tolerant computation based on superconductor technology is unlikely (<5% confidence) to be exhibited before 2026, and that quantum devices capable of factoring RSA-2048 are unlikely (<5% confidence) to exist before 2039.

It can also provide improvements in terms of speed and accuracy for some existing technologies, such as machine learning. These technologies have numerous applications in 5G and beyond networks. However, due to such abilities of quantum computing, it can also pose a serious risk to many existing security systems, especially the asymmetric key cryptography schemes. The risk of quantum computing has also influenced the mobile broadband standards to move from a symmetric key cryptography techniques to PKI-based trust model.

7,1,C5,Chancellor (2016),2016,Modernizing quantum annealing using local searches,(missing journal),10.1088/1367-2630/AA59C4,"I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state space) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches traditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm (QAA). Such protocols will have numerous advantages over simple quantum annealing. By using such searches the effect of problem mis-specification can be reduced, as only energy differences between the searched states will be relevant. The QAA is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical technique which has now been superseded. Hence, I explore two strategies to use an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization algorithms. Specifically, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can be used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering which use quantum searches as subroutines. The techniques given here can be applied not only to optimization, but also to sampling. I examine the feasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such protocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the flux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc. I further provide proof-of-principle numerical experiments based on quantum Monte Carlo that demonstrate simple examples of the discussed techniques.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125745812&doi=10.1109%2fTCSI.2022.3152591&partnerID=40&md5=aae2378e52c89cb62b36d739647a6a63,Article,1,0.845637143,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.128927358,0,0.171005534,0,0,0.128556881,0,0,0.136700918,0,0,0.095421852,0,0.244305063,0,0,0,0,0.107129167,0.137109071,0.138761739,0,0.150854865,0,0,0,0.140022861,0,0.11556454,0,0,0,0,0,0.180119471,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.318935728,0,0,0.274218142,0.087522972,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.123186696,0,0,0,0.325724659,0.091238543,0,0,0.115881992,0,0,0,0,0.136294732,0.317970554,0,0.472082008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.114306555,0.069216959,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.156326504,0,4.477385363,0.695567277

11,2,C6,Koller & Friedman (2009),2009,Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques - Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning,(missing journal),(missing DOI),"Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reasonto reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.

However, the distance over which QKD is achievable has been limited to a few hundred kilometres, owing to the channel loss that occurs when using optical fibres or terrestrial free space that exponentially reduces the photon transmission rate. Satellite-based QKD has the potential to help to establish a global-scale quantum network, owing to the negligible photon loss and decoherence experienced in empty space. Here we report the development and launch of a low-Earth-orbit satellite for implementing decoy-state QKD-a form of QKD that uses weak coherent pulses at high channel loss and is secure because photon-number-splitting eavesdropping can be detected. We achieve a kilohertz key rate from the satellite to the ground over a distance of up to 1,200 kilometres. This key rate is around 20 orders of magnitudes greater than that expected using an optical fibre of the same length.

This methodology consists of a standardized set of questions which should be asked to determine how and indeed if, near term quantum computing can play a role in a given application. Developing such a set of questions is important because it allows different use cases to be evaluated in a fair and objective way, rather than considering each case on an ad hoc basis which could lead to an evaluation which focuses on positives of a use case, while ignoring weaknesses. To demonstrate our methodology we apply it to a concrete use case, ambulance dispatch, and find that there are some ways in which near term quantum computing could be deployed sensibly, but also demonstrate some cases ways in which its use would not be advised.

In this paper, we present a landscaping study with a gathered dataset of 441 companies from 42 countries that we identify as quantum start-ups, meaning that they mainly focus on quantum technologies (QT) as their primary priority business. We answer the following questions: (1) What are the temporal and geographical distributions of the quantum start-ups? (2) How can we categorize them, and how are these categories populated? (3) Are there any patterns that we can derive from empirical data on trends? We found that more than 92% of these companies have been founded within the last 10 years, and more than 50% of them are located in the US, the UK, and Canada. We categorized the QT start-ups into six fields: (i) complementary technologies, (ii) quantum computing (hardware), (iii) quantum computing (software/application/simulation), (iv) quantum cryptography/communication, (v) quantum sensing and metrology, and (vi) supporting companies, and analyzed the population of each field both for countries, and temporally. Finally, we argue that low levels of quantum start-up activity in a country might be an indicator of a national initiative to be adopted afterwards, which later sees both an increase in the number of start-ups, and a diversification of activity in different QT fields.

Moreover, the abstraction of tasks and services offered by the quantum network should enable platform-independent applications to be executed without the knowledge of the underlying physical implementation. Here we experimentally demonstrate, using remote solid-state quantum network nodes, a link layer, and a physical layer protocol for entanglement-based quantum networks. The link layer abstracts the physical-layer entanglement attempts into a robust, platform-independent entanglement delivery service. The system is used to run full state tomography of the delivered entangled states, as well as preparation of a remote qubit state on a server by its client. Our results mark a clear transition from physics experiments to quantum communication systems, which will enable the development and testing of components of future quantum networks.

The theoretical foundation of QPP leverages the linear algebraic representations of quantum gates which makes QPP realizable in both, quantum and classical systems. By applying the QPP with 64 of 8-bit permutation gates, holding respective entropy of over 100,000 bits, we accomplished quantum random number distributions digitally over todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classical internet. The QPP has also been used to create pseudo quantum random numbers and served as a foundation for quantum-safe lightweight block and streaming ciphers. This paper continues to explore numerous applications of QPP, namely, we present an implementation of QPP as a quantum encryption circuit on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still noisy quantum computers. With the publicly available 5-qubit IBMQ devices, we demonstrate quantum secure encryption (256 bits of entropy) using 2-qubit QPP with 56 permutation gates, and 3-qubit QPP with 17 permutation gates respectively. Initial qubits of the encryption circuit correspond to the plaintext and after applying quantum encryption operations, cipher qubits are measured with probabilistic distributions, and the results with the highest probability are recorded as cipher bits. The cipher bits are then decrypted with an inverse QPP circuit. The output state plaintext qubits are measured and the most frequent count measurement results are recorded as plaintext bits. This quantum encryption and decryption process clearly demonstrates that QPP quantum implementations works exactly as symmetric encryption and decryption schemes should. The plaintext and ciphertext bits can also be encrypted and decrypted respectively by any classical computing device with the corresponding QPP algorithm as in quantum computers. This work reveals that it is possible to build quantum-secure communications between quantum-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical computers over todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s internet and the future quantum internet.

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ6GÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed. Finally, specific issues have been incorporated to give new insight into future development approaches towards 6G based on developing demands in the coming years.

In this paper, we highlight that classical atmospheric statistical models can be applied for describing random fluctuations of the quantum channels.

Important insights of the physical channel effects including pointing errors and atmospheric turbulence on the QBER and SKL are then revealed.

Cryptographic protocols at the MAC layer and higher tiers of the protocol stack are under threat as a result of quantum computer developments. Optical physical layer encryption has great advantages in optical communication security transmission, which can be compatible with a variety of networks, and achieve an efficient and secured ultra-high high-speed data transmission. In this work, we propose a physical layer encryption scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (OFDM-PD-NOMA) technique for the dynamic key hiding transmission and multi-dimensional disturbance. The encryption scheme realizes multi-point mutual-coupling key transmission and multi-dimensional disturbance encryption by a 3D discrete chaotic model. The encrypted data and the dynamic key are transmitted together by multichannel signals in PD-NOMA, then, the chaotic signal generated by chaotic generator is used to mask the dynamic key. 3D chaotic sequences generated by the dynamic key are used to encrypt bits, symbols and carriers of the original signal. The initial key, the dynamic key and the chaotic signal realize multi-point mutual-coupling. We conduct a 74.6 Gb/s encrypted quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)-OFDM-PD-NOMA signal transmission over 2 km 7 core fiber. The key space of encrypted scheme can reach 10462. Finally, experimental results show that the original data can be recovered accurately, and the bit error rate (BER) of the dynamic key is close to zero. The security and reliability of the system have been verified, and this scheme has an important application prospect in the future optical communication system.

However, the secret key rates of the reported CVQKD systems are only a few Mbps over typical transmission distance so far. Here, we address the fundamental experimental problems and demonstrate a single-carrier four-state CVQKD with sub-Gbps key rate within metropolitan area. In the demonstrated four-state CVQKD using local local oscillator, an ultra-low level of excess noise is obtained and a high efficient post-processing setup is designed for practically extracting the final secure keys. Thus, the achieved secret key rates are 190.54 Mbps, 137.76 Mbps and 52.48 Mbps using linear channel assuming security analysis method and 233.87 Mbps, 133.6 Mbps and 21.53 Mbps using semidefinite programming security analysis method over transmission distances of 5 km, 10 km and 25 km, respectively. This result increases the asymptotic secret key rate to sub-Gbps level, which is sufficient to achieve the one-time pad cryptographic task. Moreover, our work shows the road for future high-rate and large-scale CVQKD deployment in secure broadband metropolitan and access networks.

How to realize QKDs among multiple users in an effective and simple way is crucial for its real applications in communication networks. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fully connected QKD network without trusted node for a large number of users. Using flexible wavelength division multiplexing/demultiplexing and space division multiplexing, entanglement resources generated by a broadband energy-time entangled quantum light source are distributed to 40 users. Any two users share a part of entanglement resources, by which QKD is established between them. As a result, it realizes a fully connected network with 40 users and 780 QKD links. The performance of this network architecture is also discussed theoretically, showing its potential on developing quantum communication networks with large user numbers owing to its simplicity, scalability, and high efficiency.

(2022),2022,A new method of software vulnerability detection based on a quantum neural network,Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-022-11227-3,"In the field of network security, although there has been related work on software vulnerability detection based on classic machine learning, detection ability is directly proportional to the scale of training data. A quantum neural network has been proven to solve the memory bottleneck problem of classical machine learning, so it has far-reaching prospects in the field of vulnerability detection. To fill the gap in this field, we propose a quantum neural network structure named QDENN for software vulnerability detection. This work is the first attempt to implement word embedding of vulnerability codes based on a quantum neural network, which proves the feasibility of a quantum neural network in the field of vulnerability detection. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed QDENN can effectively solve the inconsistent input length problem of quantum neural networks and the problem of batch processing with long sentences. Furthermore, it can give full play to the advantages of quantum computing and realize a vulnerability detection model at the cost of a small amount of measurement. Compared to other quantum neural networks, our proposed QDENN can achieve higher vulnerability detection accuracy. On the sub dataset with a small-scale interval, the model accuracy rate reaches 99%. On each subinterval data, the best average vulnerability detection accuracy of the model reaches 86.3%.

IoT devices with the potential of pervasive sensing and quantifying ability, it becomes an essential segment of the future Internet. The sixth generation (6G) enabled IoT networks are predicted to transform the data sharing and communication for a future of thorough brilliant and sovereign systems. However, secure communication in a sensor network is very difficult and is more amplified by the use of latest 6G IoT technology which is vulnerable to different kinds of attacks due to their limited security features. Existing security systems like RSA and Elliptic curve cryptography which is based on large integer factors and the discrete logarithmic problem is vulnerable to the attack which emerges from quantum computers. The computing capacity of a quantum computer is higher than classical computers. A 30-qubit quantum computer has the equivalent computing capacity as a traditional silicon-based computer computes at 10 teraflops per second. To secure the communication in the present and future IoT network, an enhanced Hash-based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) architecture named Signature-based Merkle Hash Multiplication (SMHM) algorithm is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the Hash-based Merkle signature algorithm is enhanced using the Bernoulli Karatsuba Multiplication algorithm to secure the data storage and communication in IoT devices. The FPGA based proposed model is implemented in the Xilinx ISE14.5 simulator, both Hardware Descriptive Language (HDL) and High-Level Synthesis (HLS) approach is used to calculate the performance metrics which improved 33% frequency, 22% area, power consumption up to 13%, 10% error and 15% delay.

In order to optimize such architectures, it is crucial to develop tools that allow specific design space explorations. To this aim, in this paper we present a technique to perform a spatio-temporal characterization of quantum circuits running in multi-chip quantum computers. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of the qubit traffic resulting from operations that involve qubits residing in different cores, and hence quantum communication across chips, while also giving importance to the amount of intra-core operations that occur in between those communications. Using specific multi-core performance metrics and a complete set of benchmarks, our analysis showcases the opportunities that the proposed approach may provide to guide the design of multi-core quantum computers and their interconnects.

Experimental results show that the execution time to run the FrodoKEM scheme in an SoC device reduces to one-third of that obtained by the benchmark implementation (i.e., the software implementation). Also, the attained execution time and hardware resource usage of this SoC-based implementation of the FrodoKEM scheme show that lattice-based cryptography may fit into SM equipment.

In general, the QKD protocols proposed for the multiparty scenario often involve the usage of a maximally entangled state, such as GreenbergerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“HorneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zeilinger (GHZ), which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper examines the prepare and measure version of multiparty communication through quantum key distribution. It is sufficient to have the capability of preparing and measuring a single qubit state. The security of the multiparty prepare and measure QKD is demonstrated by utilizing the well-known techniques of quantum error correction and entanglement purification. We begin by establishing the security of the entangled-based version and progress through a series of reductions to arrive at our equivalent multiparty prepare and measure version of QKD. We establish the security proof of multiparty entangled-based version with the help of classical statistics on the GHZ basis. Then proved the conditional security of the multiparty prepare-and-measure QKD by the equivalency.

(2022),2022,Open-Air Microwave Entanglement Distribution for Quantum Teleportation,Physical Review Applied,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.18.044002,"Microwave technology plays a central role in current wireless communications, including mobile communication and local area networks. The microwave range shows relevant advantages with respect to other frequencies in open-air transmission, such as low absorption losses and low-energy consumption, and in addition, it is the natural working frequency in superconducting quantum technologies. Entanglement distribution between separate parties is at the core of secure quantum communications. Therefore, understanding its limitations in realistic open-air settings, especially in the rather unexplored microwave regime, is crucial for transforming microwave quantum communications into a mainstream technology. Here, we investigate the feasibility of an open-air entanglement distribution scheme with microwave two-mode squeezed states. First, we study the reach of direct entanglement transmission in open air, obtaining a maximum distance of approximately 500 m with parameters feasible for state-of-the-art experiments. Subsequently, we adapt entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping protocols to microwave technology in order to reduce the environment-induced entanglement degradation. The employed entanglement distillation helps to increase quantum correlations in the short-distance low-squeezing regime by up to 46%, and the reach of entanglement increases by 14% with entanglement swapping. Importantly, we compute the fidelity of a continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol using open-air-distributed entanglement as a resource. Finally, we adapt this machinery to explore the limitations of quantum communication between satellites, where the impact of thermal noise is substantially reduced and diffraction losses are dominant.

(2022),2022,Post-quantum cryptography techniques for secure communication in resource-constrained Internet of Things devices: A comprehensive survey,Software - Practice and Experience,10.1002/spe.3121,"As the number and characteristics of smart devices change, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges. The IoT provides the connected devices with a variety of resources that enable effective communication. At this point, several security issues arise to get the sensitive information behind every communication in the IoT. To provide users with security and privacy, cryptographic schemes are adopted, the most popular being public key cryptographic systems (PKC). However, with the advent of quantum computing, the level of security that can be provided by the PKC schemes is a big question. Another important issue is that the IoT environment is resource-constrained, which necessitates the implementation of lightweight cryptographic algorithms for better security. In response to these issues, the post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes are one of the significant developments contributing to IoT security in the post-quantum world. This article examines the key security issues in the IoT environment and examines the effective solutions found in the literature. The problems in IoT in the quantum era are discussed and appropriate solutions by PKC schemes under limited resources in IoT are focused. As the lattice-based cryptosystems are more effective, the importance of these schemes in the resource-constrained IoT is highlighted. This survey also leads to feasible future directions that can support developers and researchers in this field.

(2022),2022,Analysis of the NTRU Post-Quantum Cryptographic Scheme in Constrained IoT Edge Devices,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3162254,"Research on post-quantum cryptography aims to solve the problematic of modern public-key cryptography being broken by attacks coming from quantum computers in the future and, moreover, by using classical electronics. This task is so critical that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the final process of standardizing post-quantum schemes for the future protection of embedded applications. Though there are some research work done on embedded systems, it is important to study the impact of these proposals in realistic environments for the Internet of Things (IoT), where the limited computational resources and the strict requirements for power consumption can become incompatible with the usage of cryptographic schemes. In this work, the performance of one of the finalists of the standardization process called NTRU is studied and implemented in a custom wireless sensor node designed for applications in the extreme edge of the IoT. The cryptosystem is implemented and evaluated within the processes of the Contiki-NG operating system. Furthermore, additional experiments are performed to check if commonly integrated hardware peripherals for cryptography inside modern microcontrollers can be used to achieve better performance with NTRU, not only at the single node level but also at the network level, where the NTRU key encapsulation mechanism is tested in a real communication process. The results derived from these experiments show that NTRU is suitable for modern microcontrollers targeting wireless sensor networks design, while old devices present in popular platforms might not afford the cost of its implementation.

Here, we present our approach to an open-source, extensible framework for explorations of chemical reaction mechanisms based on the first-principles of quantum mechanics. It is intended to facilitate reaction network explorations for diverse chemical problems with a wide range of goals such as mechanism elucidation, reaction path optimization, retrosynthetic path validation, reagent design, and microkinetic modeling. The stringent first-principles basis of all algorithms in our framework is key for the general applicability that avoids any restrictions to specific chemical systems. Such an agile framework requires multiple specialized software components of which we present three modules in this work. The key module, Chemoton, drives the exploration of reaction networks. For the exploration itself, we introduce two new algorithms for elementary-step searches that are based on Newton trajectories. The performance of these algorithms is assessed for a variety of reactions characterized by a broad chemical diversity in terms of bonding patterns and chemical elements. Chemoton successfully recovers the vast majority of these. We provide the resulting data, including large numbers of reactions that were not included in our reference set, to be used as a starting point for further explorations and for future reference.

Measurement-device-independent quantum secret sharing (MDI-QSS) is immune to all possible attacks from measurement devices and can greatly enhance QSSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s security in practical applications.

It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work provides an initial step toward this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory of near-term quantum networks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we show that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical framework to model protocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific implementation platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links introduced in prior work and by providing new results on policies for elementary links in the steady-state (infinite-time) limit. Then, we show how the elementary link MDP can be used to analyze a complete quantum network protocol. We then provide an extension of the MDP formalism to two elementary links. Here, as new results, we derive linear programing relaxations that allow us to obtain optimal steady-state policies with respect to the expected fidelity and waiting time of the end-to-end link.

So far, similarly to the early age of classical computing, these designs have been crafted by human experts. These general-purpose architectures, however, leave room for customization and optimization, especially when targeting popular near-term QC applications. In classical computing, customized architectures have demonstrated significant performance and energy efficiency gains over general-purpose counterparts. In this paper, we present a framework for optimizing quantum architectures, specifically through customizing qubit connectivity. It is the first work that (1) provides performance guarantees by integrating architecture optimization with an optimal compiler, (2) evaluates the impact of connectivity customization under a realistic crosstalk error model, and (3) benchmarks on realistic circuits of near-term interest, such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN). We demonstrate up to 59% fidelity improvement in simulation by optimizing the heavy-hexagon architecture for QAOA maxcut circuits, and up to 14% improvement on the grid architecture. For the QCNN circuit, architecture optimization improves fidelity by 11% on the heavy-hexagon architecture and 605% on the grid architecture.

With the emergence of quantum supremacy on the horizon, the security of various classical encryption systems soon may be deemed obsolete. As a remedy, quantum key distribution (QKD) is proposed as a novel quantum-based secret keys exchange, which is developed to solve the problems of legacy encryption. It is anticipated that QKD will provide stronger security for future communication systems even in the presence of malicious quantum attacks. As the QKD research and development is getting mature, the theoretical use cases of QKD in various industries are proliferating. In this treatise, we summarise the potential applications of QKD for future communication technology while highlighting the ongoing standardisation efforts essential for the sustainability and reliability of the near-future deployment.

45,2,C2,Cooper (2022),2022,Exploring Potential Applications of Quantum Computing in Transportation Modelling,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,10.1109/TITS.2021.3132161,"The idea that quantum effects could be harnessed to allow faster computation was first proposed by Feynman. As of 2020 we appear to have achieved 'quantum supremacy', that is, a quantum computer that performs a given task faster than its classical counterpart. This paper examines some possibilities opened up by potential future application of quantum computing to transportation simulation and planning. To date, no such research was found to exist, therefore we begin with an introduction to quantum computing for the programmers of transport models. We discuss existing quantum computing research relevant to transportation, finding developments in network analysis, shortest path computation, multi-objective routing, optimization and calibration - of which the latter three appear to offer the greater promise in future research. Two examples are developed in greater detail, (1) an application of Grover's quantum algorithm for extracting the mean, which has general applicability towards summarizing distributions which are expensive to compute classically, is applied to an assignment or betweenness model - quantum speedup is elusive in the general case but achievable when trading speed for accuracy for limited outputs; (2) quantum optimization is applied to an activity-based model, giving a theoretically quadratic speedup. Recent developments notwithstanding, implementation of quantum transportation algorithms will for the foreseeable future remain a challenge due to space overheads imposed by the requirement for reversible computation.

Traditionally, this trend has been primarily seen as a serious risk for cryptography; however, a positive aspect of quantum technology should also be stressed. In this regard, viewing this technology as a resource for honest parties rather than adversaries, it may enhance not only the security, but also the performance of specific cryptographic schemes. While considerable effort has been devoted to the design of quantum-resistant and quantum-enhanced schemes, little effort has been made to understanding their physical security. Physical security deals with the design and implementation of security measures fulfilling the practical requirements of cryptographic primitives, which are equally essential for classic and quantum ones. This survey aims to draw greater attention to the importance of physical security, with a focus on secure key generation and storage as well as secure execution. More specifically, the possibility of performing side-channel analysis in the quantum world is discussed and compared to attacks launched in the classic world. Besides, proposals for quantum random number generation and quantum physically unclonable functions are compared to their classic counterparts and further analyzed to give a better understanding of their features, advantages, and shortcomings. Finally, seen from these three perspectives, this survey provides an outlook for future research in this direction.

To achieve equilibrium of energy consumption, system resource utilization, and overall transmission capacity, an energy-efficient resource management strategy concerning power allocation and antenna selection is designed. A continuous quantum-inspired termite colony optimization (CQTCO) algorithm is proposed as a solution to the resource management considering the communication reliability while promoting energy conservation for the CCFD massive MIMO system. The effectiveness of CQTCO compared with other algorithms is evaluated through simulations. The results reveal that the proposed resource management scheme under CQTCO can obtain a superior performance in different communication scenarios, which can be considered as an eco-friendly solution for promoting reliable and efficient communication in future wireless networks.

Furthermore, our study considers more device imperfections than most previous experiments, and the proposed theory can be extended to other discrete-variable QKD systems.

51,6,C3,Vest et al. (2022),2022,Quantum key Distribution with a Hand-Held Sender Unit,Physical Review Applied,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.18.024067,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a crucial component for truly secure communication, which enables the leakage of information due to eavesdropper attacks to be analyzed. Although impressive progress was made in the field of long-distance implementations, user-oriented applications involving short-distance links have mostly remained overlooked. Recent technological advances in integrated photonics now enable developments towards QKD also for existing hand-held communication platforms. In this work we report on the design and evaluation of a hand-held free-space QKD system including a micro-optics-based sender unit. This system implements the BB84 protocol employing polarization-encoded faint laser pulses at a rate of 100MHz. Unidirectional beam tracking and live reference-frame alignment systems at the receiver side enable a stable operation over tens of seconds when aiming the portable transmitter to the receiver input by hand from a distance of about half a meter. The user-friendliness of our system was confirmed by successful key exchanges performed by different untrained users with an average link efficiency of about 20% relative to the case of the transmitter being stationarily mounted and aligned. In these tests we achieve an average quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of 2.4% and asymptotic secret key rates ranging from 4.0kbps to 15.3kbps. Given its compactness, the versatile sender optics is also well suited for integration into other free-space communication systems enabling QKD over any distance. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 authors.

We first construct (2 n+ 1 ) -qubit entangled channels via Hadamard gates and controlled-NOT gates and then propose two new (n+ 2 ) -party schemes for the quantum broadcast and multi-cast communications to guarantee that the sender can broadcast arbitrary complex coefficient single-qubit states to the n receivers, respectively, and synchronously under the control of the supervisor. In the first scheme, the quantum information transmitted synchronously comes from the same arbitrary complex coefficient single-qubit state, while the second scheme guarantees that the information is different among the n receivers to satisfy the requirement of the quantum multi-cast communications. Each scheme introduces auxiliary qubits and employs the feedforward strategy so that each receiver can successfully obtain the desired quantum state with success probability 100%. The feasibility of physical experiment, the security and the controllerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s control power of the presented schemes are also discussed, repetitively.

Many works have examined the behavior of the fall of stock markets and have built models to predict them. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the available research, and the literature calls for more investigation on the topic, as currently the accuracy of the models remains low and they have only been extended for the largest economies. This study provides a comparison of quantum forecast methods and stock market declines and, therefore, a new prediction model of stock market crashes via real-time recession probabilities with the power to accurately estimate future global stock market downturn scenarios is achieved. A 104-country sample has been used, allowing the sample compositions to take into account the regional diversity of the alert warning indicators. To obtain a robust model, several alternative techniques have been employed on the sample under study, being Quantum Boltzmann Machines, which have obtained very good prediction results due to their ability to remember features and develop long-term dependencies from time series and sequential data. Our model has large policy implications for the appropriate macroeconomic policy response to downside risks, offering tools to help achieve financial stability at the international level.

Using ShorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s algorithm on a large-enough quantum computer, an attacker can cryptanalyze any RSA/ECC public key and generate fake digital signatures in seconds. If this vulnerability is left unaddressed, digital communications and electronic transactions can potentially be without the assurance of authenticity and non-repudiation. In this paper, we study the use of digital signatures in 14 real-world applications across the financial, critical infrastructure, Internet, and enterprise sectors. Besides understanding the digital signing usage, we compare the applicationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ signing requirements against all six NISTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization round 3 candidate algorithms. This is done through a proposed framework where we map out the suitability of each algorithm against the applicationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ requirements in a feasibility matrix.

This test originates from the foundations of quantum physics and also ensures robustness against implementation loopholes13, thereby leaving only the integrity of the usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ locations to be guaranteed by other means. The realization of DIQKD, however, is extremely challengingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âmainly because it is difficult to establish high-quality entangled states between two remote locations with high detection efficiency. Here we present an experimental system that enables for DIQKD between two distant users. The experiment is based on the generation and analysis of event-ready entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms located in buildings 400 metre apart14. By achieving an entanglement fidelity of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â±ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥0.892(23) and implementing a DIQKD protocol with random key basis15, we observe a significant violation of a Bell inequality of S = 2.578(75)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âabove the classical limit of 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âand a quantum bit error rate of only 0.078(9).

Central to these networks is the ability to distribute entanglement between distant nodes using photonic channels. Initially developed for quantum teleportation3,4 and loophole-free tests of BellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inequality5,6, recently, entanglement distribution has also been achieved over telecom fibres and analysed retrospectively7,8. Yet, to fully use entanglement over long-distance quantum network links it is mandatory to know it is available at the nodes before the entangled state decays. Here we demonstrate heralded entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms generated over fibre links with a length up to 33 km. For this, we generate atomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“photon entanglement in two nodes located in buildings 400 m line-of-sight apart and to overcome high-attenuation losses in the fibres convert the photons to telecom wavelength using polarization-preserving quantum frequency conversion9. The long fibres guide the photons to a Bell-state measurement setup in which a successful photonic projection measurement heralds the entanglement of the atoms10. Our results show the feasibility of entanglement distribution over telecom fibre links useful, for example, for device-independent quantum key distribution11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“13 and quantum repeater protocols.

(2022),2022,Accelerating spiking neural networks using quantum algorithm with high success probability and high calculation accuracy,Neurocomputing,10.1016/j.neucom.2022.02.004,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a kind of neuromorphic computing which meticulously imitates the operations of biological nervous systems. Thus, the SNN is seen as a promising approach to further improve the level of intelligence that the legacy artificial neural networks achieved. In a spiking neuron of an SNN, it is a key step with the highest computing complexity to find out the moment when the output stimuli occur. Classic computer (i.e., electrical computer) based acceleration cannot reduce the computational complexity of the operations in the spiking neurons. As a result, the SNN suffers from scaling and deeper emulation problems. Considering these, in this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm to reduce the complexity of the key steps in the SNN and use this algorithm to build a quantum spiking neuron network (QSNN). More specifically, first, we give mathematical proof that the problem of finding the output stimuli is approximately equal to the problem of calculating the unsigned vector inner products, which can transfer to a quantum operation. Second, we design a scalable quantum circuit of QSNN for data of any dimension and evaluate its basic success probability and calculation accuracy. Third, to improve the QSNN performance, we propose a method to improve the minimum success probability to 99.8%, by repeatedly performing the quantum circuit only 11 times. Fourth, we prove that the computational complexity of the QSNN is a log-polynomial relationship with the data dimension, which is much lower than that of the linear complexity of the classic SNN. Finally, we apply the QSNN to solve classification tasks on two real-world datasets, i.e., MNIST and fashion MNIST which both have two noise levels (i.e., no noise and 50% of the noise). The experiment results show that in addition to the acceleration, QSNN and SNN have equal classification accuracy, which suggests the feasibility and robustness of the QSNN.

But would such a theory, which effectively describes the behavior of microscopic physical systems and its predicted phenomena such as quantum entanglement, still be applicable on large length scales? From a practical perspective, how can quantum key distribution (where the security of establishing secret keys between distant parties is ensured by the laws of quantum mechanics) be made technologically useful on a global scale? Owing to photon loss in optical fibers and terrestrial free space, the achievable distance using direct transmission of single photons has been limited to a few hundred kilometers. A promising route to testing quantum physics over long distances and in the relativistic regimes, and thus realizing flexible global-scale quantum networks, is via the use of satellites and space-based technologies, where a significant advantage is that the photon loss and turbulence predominantly occurs in the lower ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã‚Â¼10 km of the atmosphere, and most of the photons' transmission path in space is virtually in vacuum, with almost zero absorption and decoherence. Progress in free-space quantum experiments, with a focus on the fast-developing Micius satellite-based quantum communications, is reviewed. The perspective of space-ground integrated quantum networks and fundamental quantum optics experiments in space conceivable with satellites are discussed.

This protocol is referred to as the dihedral coset problem (DCP) challenge. The verifier needs to prepare quantum states encoding secrets (DCP samples) and send them to the prover. The prover is then tasked with recovering those secrets with a certain accuracy. Numerical simulation demonstrates that this accuracy is sensitive to errors in quantum hardware.

Prepare and measure quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols like BB84 consider the satellite as a trusted device, which is fraught with security threat looking at the current trend for satellite-based optical communication. Therefore, entanglement-based protocols must be preferred, so that one can consider the satellite as an untrusted device. The current work reports the effect of atmospheric aerosols on the key rate obtained with BBM92 QKD protocol, an entanglement-based QKD protocol over 200 m distance, using an indigenous facility developed at Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, India. Our results show that concentration and extinction coefficient of atmospheric aerosols play a major role in influencing the observed sift key rate, and eventually, the secure key rate. Such experiments are important to validate the models to account for the atmospheric effects on the key rates achieved through satellite-based QKD.

However, the staggering computational complexity of these methods is such that for state-of-the-art performance, classical hardware requirements represent a significant bottleneck to further progress. Here we take the first steps to understanding whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) could meet the demand for more powerful architectures and test its effectiveness in proof-of-principle hybrid experiments. Interestingly, we observe a numerical advantage for the learning of visual representations using small-scale QNN over equivalently structured classical networks, even when the quantum circuits are sampled with only 100 shots. Furthermore, we apply our best quantum model to classify unseen images on the ibmq_paris quantum computer and find that current noisy devices can already achieve equal accuracy to the equivalent classical model on downstream tasks.

This article aims to present a provably secure post-quantum authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol from supersingular isogenies under the extended CanettiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Krawczyk (eCK) security model, and provide an alternative for protecting communications over open channels from being attacked in the near future post-quantum era. Thus, the expected post-quantum AKE protocol from supersingular isogenies is presented in this article using the well-known SIDH and SIKE as its building blocks. The new post-quantum AKE protocol is formally proved secure under the strong eCK security model, which actually can also be formally proved secure in the CK + security model. In addition, the relatively time-consuming encapsulation algorithm can be performed in advance in the new AKE protocol, so in practice, the new AKE protocol may gain efficiency advantage over some existing AKE protocols from supersingular isogenies. So, considering the overall security and computation efficiency, it can be said that the presented post-quantum AKE protocol may be a good choice in the upcoming post-quantum era.

(2022),2022,High-Precision Voltage Measurement for Optical Quantum Computation,Energies,10.3390/en15124205,"This paper presents a theoretical study into the use of optical systems for quantum computation. The study results pertain to quantum sampling and quantum communication and provide a basis for further research and the development of a physical implementation. We propose an optical superstructure that can implement specific computation processes and algorithms. The superstructure is composed of nonlinear optical units, such as beta barium borate crystals. The units are positioned in series, powered by a pulse laser pump, and culminate in a beam splitter that generates the output state of a number of entangled photon pairs. Computation is achieved by entanglement propagation via beam splitters and adjustable phase shifters, which set related parameters. Demonstrating a two-component case, we show how a series of cosine-based components can be implemented. The obtained results open a broad front for future research. Future work should investigate the construction of a quantum optimizer using quantum sampling methods and also investigate high-precision temporal voltage measurement, which is a key procedure for the construction of high-fidelity devices.

(2022),2022,An Efficient Semi-Quantum Key Distribution Protocol and Its Security Proof,IEEE Communications Letters,10.1109/LCOMM.2022.3158906,"The idea of semi-quantum communication protocols provides a theoretical solution for the high costs of quantum resources. In this study, we propose an efficient semi-quantum key distribution protocol that allows Alice and quantum-capable restricted Bob to establish a secure key. Then, we demonstrate that the protocol is information-theoretic secure in the asymptotic scenario. As long as the channel noise is less than the noise tolerance of the protocol, Alice and Bob can withdraw a secure key. The proposed protocol has advantages over previous protocols regarding qubit efficiency and communication cost. Besides, our efficiency analysis is more fair and practical because noise factors are taken into account. Based on these features, it may have potential applications in future quantum communications.

There are important applications of PSI-CA in real society, e.g., strongly privacy-preserving data statistics in contact tracing for health authorities to fight the outbreaks of highly contagious diseases. In this paper, we present a novel quantum PSI-CA protocol, in which we adopt oblivious quantum key distribution, secure quantum summation and quantum counting algorithm. The proposed PSI-CA protocol not only ensures the approximatively perfect security but also achieves the linear communication complexity, i.e., O(N). Furthermore, we define a new privacy protection problem, i.e., Privacy-preserving Condition Query (PCQ), and provide an efficient solution to the PCQ problem based on the proposed quantum PSI-CA protocol. Finally, we verify the correctness and the feasibility of the proposed quantum PSI-CA protocol by circuit simulations in IBM Qiskit.

(2022),2022,Mixed Certificate Chains for the Transition to Post-Quantum Authentication in TLS 1.3,ASIA CCS 2022 - Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,10.1145/3488932.3497755,"Large-scale quantum computers will be able to efficiently solve the underlying mathematical problems of widely deployed public key cryptosystems in the near future. This threat has sparked increased interest in the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and standardization bodies like NIST, IETF, and ETSI are in the process of standardizing PQC schemes as a new generation of cryptography. This raises the question of how to ensure a fast, reliable, and secure transition to upcoming PQC standards in today's highly interconnected world. In this work, we propose and investigate a migration strategy towards post-quantum (PQ) authentication for the network protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS). Our strategy is based on the concept of ""mixed certificate chains""that use different signature algorithms within the same certificate chain. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our migration strategy, we combine the well-studied and trusted hash-based signature schemes SPHINCS+ and XMSS with elliptic curve cryptography first and subsequently with lattice-based PQC signature schemes (CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon). Furthermore, we combine authentication based on mixed certificate chains with the lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) CRYSTALS-Kyber as representative for PQC KEMs to evaluate a fully post-quantum and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3 handshake. Our results show that mixed certificate chains containing hash-based signature schemes only at the root certificate authority level lead to feasible connection establishment times despite the increase in communication size. By analyzing code size and peak memory usage of our client and server programs we further demonstrate the suitability of our migration strategy even for embedded devices.

Digital twin technology can be applied in 3D IoT smart factories, new smart city construction, smart medical care, digital energy, digital archives, warehousing and logistics visualization and other fields. Deep learning covers a wide range of applications and is extremely common. This paper discusses the application of the two in the risk prediction of coal and gas outburst strength. This paper firstly describes the method of predicting coal and gas outburst intensity. For example, the BP neural network algorithm applied to the prediction of coal and gas outburst intensity in deep learning, the air flow control system model of digital twin for coal mines, and the risk assessment algorithm of coal and gas outburst intensity in coal mines based on grey relational analysis, and various ways to predict risk. And the system model is designed in this paper. Combined with the Formula, this paper describes the process of predicting risk in detail, and then conducts experiments based on digital twin and deep learning to predict coal and gas outburst intensity. In this paper, digital twin is used to systematically design coal and gas outburst intensity prediction, and a neural network prediction model based on optimized quantum gate nodes is established. In this paper, the practical application experiment and result analysis of the optimization algorithm in the coal and gas outburst prediction model are carried out, and the conclusion is drawn. After QGNN is optimized by the sdPSO algorithm, the error is extremely small, only 2.0914, and the specific value of the prediction accuracy in practical applications is as high as 95%. The experimental data verifies the feasibility of digital twin and deep learning technology in the prediction of coal and gas outburst intensity.

Quantum teleportation allows for the reliable transfer of quantum information between distant nodes, even in the presence of highly lossy network connections3. Although many experimental demonstrations have been performed on different quantum network platforms4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“10, moving beyond directly connected nodes has, so far, been hindered by the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint qubit readout and coherence times. Here we realize quantum teleportation between remote, non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network. The network uses three optically connected nodes based on solid-state spin qubits. The teleporter is prepared by establishing remote entanglement on the two links, followed by entanglement swapping on the middle node and storage in a memory qubit. We demonstrate that, once successful preparation of the teleporter is heralded, arbitrary qubit states can be teleported with fidelity above the classical bound, even with unit efficiency. These results are enabled by key innovations in the qubit readout procedure, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation and tailored heralding that reduces remote entanglement infidelities.

It has already been used in an inter-city fiber channel and near-Earth atmosphere channel, leaving an underwater channel the last barrier to conquer.

76,3,C1,Ulitzsch et al. (2022),2022,A Post-Quantum Secure Subscription Concealed Identifier for 6G,WiSec 2022 - Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks,10.1145/3507657.3528540,"5G saw the introduction of an encrypted user identifier, the Subscriber Concealed Identifier (SUCI), to provide confidentiality of the subscriber's whereabouts and identities. The SUCI protects the new generation of cellular networks against tracking devices, so-called IMSI-catchers, which have undermined users' confidentiality ever since the inception of cellular networks. However, the potential advent of large-scale quantum computers in the near future threatens to compromise the confidentiality provided by the SUCI yet again. The security of the public-key cryptography that underpins the SUCI relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Using Shor's algorithm, a quantum adversary could break the SUCI's cryptography and once more gain the capability to track and identify users. Advancements in quantum computing are unpredictable, and a breakthrough might be only a decade away. Given the slow nature of standards and their implementation, it is thus necessary to already integrate now quantum-resistant cryptography into the current and also next-generation (6G) cellular networks. To contribute to this development, we propose a post-quantum secure scheme for the SUCI calculation, KEMSUCI. To this end, we first analyze the weak points in the current SUCI calculation scheme when considering quantum attacks. We then describe an alternative SUCI calculation scheme based on post-quantum secure key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). Our proposed scheme can use any of the KEMs submitted to the NIST call for standardization of post-quantum secure cryptography (PQC) schemes. For the usage in KEMSUCI, the KEM should provide efficient execution on a SIM card and induce little network communication overhead. We evaluate all of the NIST PQC finalists under these aspects and identify Kyber and Saber as the best fit. Instantiated with these KEMs, KEMSUCI can be integrated into 5G and 6G. Compared to the existing SUPI protection schemes, KEMSUCI exhibits faster execution speed and only little communication overhead.

(2022),2022,Efficient frame synchronization using a weak coherent state for continuous-variable quantum key distribution,Physical Review A,10.1103/PhysRevA.105.052407,"Frame synchronization is a crucial step in quantum key distribution (QKD) and a prerequisite for secure key distillation. Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fast phase drift in the continuous-variable QKD system, efficient frame synchronization is highly demanded. In this paper, a frame-synchronization scheme based on weak coherent states is proposed. This scheme uses a train of coherent-state pulses encoded by a Zadoff-Chu sequence to achieve frame synchronization. The synchronization performance is analyzed under different transmission distances, transmit powers, frequency offsets, and phase drifts through Monte Carlo simulation. Its performance is also compared with other synchronization sequences, confirming its noise-tolerance capability. An optical experiment is conducted to verify the feasibility of the synchronization scheme under low SNR (as low as -20 dB), and the applicable SNR range can be further reduced by increasing the sequence length. Due to its efficiency and noise tolerance, this scheme can provide technical support for weak-coherent-state-based QKD and future quantum network construction.

(2022),2022,Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm applied to neural architecture search,Applied Soft Computing,10.1016/j.asoc.2022.108674,"The success of machine learning models over the last few years is mostly related to the significant progress of deep neural networks. These powerful and flexible models can even surpass human-level performance in tasks such as image recognition and strategy games. However, experts need to spend considerable time and resources to design the network structure. The demand for new architectures drives interest in automating this design process. Researchers have proposed new algorithms to address the neural architecture search (NAS) problem, including efforts to reduce the high computational cost of such methods. A common approach to improve efficiency is to reduce the search space with the help of expert knowledge, searching for cells rather than entire networks. Motivated by the faster convergence promoted by quantum-inspired evolutionary methods, the Q-NAS algorithm was proposed to address the NAS problem without relying on cell search. In this work, we consolidate Q-NAS, adding a new penalization feature, enhancing its retraining scheme, and also investigating more challenging search spaces than before. In CIFAR-10, we reached 93.85% of test accuracy in 67 GPU days, considering the addition of an early-stopping mechanism. We also applied Q-NAS to CIFAR-100, without modifying the parameters, and our best accuracy was 74.23%, which is comparable to ResNet164. The enhancements and results presented in this work show that Q-NAS can automatically generate network architectures that outperform hand-designed models for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Also, compared to other NAS methods, Q-NAS results are promising regarding the balance between performance, runtime efficiency, and automation. We believe that our results enrich the discussion on this balance, considering alternatives to the cell search approach.

With the development and progress in the research field of quantum computers, well established schemes like RSA and ECC are more and more threatened. The urgent demand to find and standardize new schemes - which are secure in a post-quantum world - was also realized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology which announced a Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project in 2017. Recently, the round three candidates were announced and one of the alternate candidates is the Key Encapsulation Mechanism scheme BIKE. In this article, we investigate different strategies to efficiently implement the BIKE algorithm on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). To this extend, we improve already existing polynomial multipliers, propose efficient strategies to realize polynomial inversions, and implement the Black-Gray-Flip decoder for the first time. Additionally, our implementation is designed to be scalable and generic with the BIKE specific parameters. All together, the fastest designs achieve latencies of 2.69 ms for the key generation, 0.1 ms for the encapsulation, and 1.89 ms for the decapsulation considering the lowest security level.

The currently under-exploited mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum is an essential building block for such an envisioned all-spectra wireless communication paradigm. Free-space optical (FSO) communications in the mid-IR region have recently attracted great interest due to their intrinsic merits of low propagation loss and high tolerance of atmospheric perturbations. Future development of viable mid-IR FSO transceivers requires a semiconductor source to fulfill the high bandwidth, low energy consumption, and small footprint requirements. In this context, quantum cascade laser (QCL) appears as a promisingtechnological choice. In this work, we present an experimental demonstration of a mid-IR FSO link enabled by a 4.65-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¼m directly modulated (DM) QCL operating at room temperature. We achieve a transmission data rate of up to 6 Gbps over a 0.5-m link distance. This achievement is enabled by system-level characterization and optimization of transmitter and receiver power level and frequency response and assisted with advanced modulation and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. This work pushes the QCL-based FSO technology one step closer to practical terrestrial applications, such as the fixed wireless access and the wireless mobile backhaul. Such a QCL-based solution offers a promising way towards the futuristic all-spectra wireless communication paradigm by potentially supporting the whole spectrum from the MIR to the terahertz (THz).

By applying a delayed-choice scheme, we overcome a limit of most currently available quantum computers, which are unable to implement further operations on measured qubits or operations conditioned on measurement results from other qubits. Moreover, we decrease the error rate of the one-way logic gates, compared to the original protocol using local operations and classical communication. In addition, we apply our deterministic one-way cnot gate in the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm to show the feasibility of our proposal.

Semi-quantum technology is used in our protocol, which allows the required capacity of the accessed device to be reduced. In addition, multiple quantum signature and blockchain technologies have also been applied to our protocol. This increases the traceability and robustness of our protocol.

Thus, the US NIST is currently exploring new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are robust against quantum computers. Security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âeven with pre-quantum public-key cryptographyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âsince IoT devices have tight energy constraints, limited computational power and strict memory limitations. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth investigation of the application of potential post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms (DSAs) proposed in the related US NIST process to a state-of-the-art, TLS-based, low-power IoT infrastructure. We implemented these new KEMs and DSAs in such a representative infrastructure and measured their impact on energy consumption, latency and memory requirements during TLS handshakes on an IoT edge device. Based on our investigations, we gained the following new insights. First, we show that the main contributor to high TLS handshake latency is the higher bandwidth requirement of post-quantum primitives rather than the cryptographic computation itself. Second, we demonstrate that a smart combination of multiple DSAs yields the most energy-, latency-and memory-efficient public key infrastructures, in contrast to NISTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goal to standardize only one algorithm. Third, we show that code-based, isogeny-based and lattice-based algorithms can be implemented on a low-power IoT edge device based on an off-the-shelf Cortex M4 microcontroller while maintaining viable battery runtimes. This is contrary to much research that claims dedicated hardware accelerators are mandatory. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 by the authors.

(2022),2022,General logic-operation-based lightweight group-key distribution schemes for Internet of Vehicles,Vehicular Communications,10.1016/j.vehcom.2022.100457,"It is predicted that the trend of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications will keep on growing due to its flexibility in infrastructure. The security of IoV can protect the peer-to-peer (P2P) data transmitted over Internet. Since most Internet devices are components with low battery power, low communication and computational power, the key distribution scheme for IoV needs to be lightweight. Most conventional communications in Internet of Vehicles are one-to-one types of communications which involve only two communication entities. Proposals for key distribution schemes are mostly developed to establish a pairwise key for a pair of users. For example, Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution scheme proposed in 1976 and the quantum key distribution scheme (QKD) invented in 1984 (also called the BB84 scheme), can only enable two users to share a secret key used in conventional one-to-one communications. Modern communications have been evolved into many-to-many types of communications which involve more than two users. Group-key distributions enable multiple users to share a group key. Recently, a lightweight group-key distribution scheme has been proposed which needs only logic operations. But this scheme can only provide confidentiality of the group key. In this paper, we extend that scheme to propose the first lightweight authenticated group-key distribution scheme which needs only logic operations. Our proposed schemes can be built on top of any type of authenticated pairwise-key distribution schemes. We first propose a basic three-party authenticated group-key distribution scheme. Then, general three multiple-party authenticated group-key distribution schemes based on the basic scheme are proposed. Since our proposed schemes need only logic operations, they are all lightweight and are suitable for P2P IoV communication applications.

Its capability to deliver secure communication regardless of the computational power of the attackers will be a fundamental feature in the next generations of telecommunication networks. Nevertheless, demonstrations of QKD implementation in a real operating scenario and their coexistence with the classical telecom infrastructure are of fundamental importance for reliable exploitation. Here we present a Quantum Key Distribution application implemented over a classical fiber-based infrastructure. We exploit a 50 MHz source at 1550 nm, a single 13 km-long fiber cable for both the quantum and the classical channel, and a simplified receiver scheme with just one single-photon detector. In this way, we achieve an error rate of approximately 2% and a secret key rate of about 1.7 kbps, thus demonstrating the feasibility of low-cost and ready-to-use Quantum Key Distribution systems compatible with standard classical infrastructure.

The achievement of these tasks requires the navigation of vast and complex chemical and biological spaces, difficult to accomplish with reasonable speed. Using modern algorithms and supercomputers, quantum physics methods are able to examine systems containing a few hundred interacting species and determine the probability of finding them in a particular region of phase space, thereby anticipating their properties. Likewise, modern approaches in chemistry and biomolecular simulation, supported by high performance computing, have culminated in producing data sets of escalating size and intrinsically high complexity. Hence, using ML to extract relevant information from these fields is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of chemical and biomolecular systems. At the heart of ML approaches lie statistical algorithms, which by evaluating a portion of a given data set, identify, learn, and manipulate the underlying rules that govern the whole data set. The assembly of a quality model to represent the data followed by the predictions and elimination of error sources are the key steps in ML. In addition to a growing infrastructure of ML tools to address complex problems, an increasing number of aspects related to our understanding of the fundamental properties of biomacromolecules are exposed to ML. These fields, including those residing at the interface of polymer science and biology (i.e., structure determination, de novo design, folding, and dynamics), strive to adopt and take advantage of the transformative power offered by approaches in the ML domain, which clearly has the potential of accelerating research in the field of biomacromolecules.

Moreover, the effective utilization of RERs to fulfill the varying electricity demands of customers can be achieved via demand response (DR). Furthermore, control techniques, decision variables and offered motivations are the ways to introduce DR into distribution network (DN). This categorization needs to be optimized to balance the supply and demand in DN. Therefore, intelligent algorithms are employed to achieve optimized DR. However, these algorithms are computationally restrained to handle the parametric load of uncertainty involved with RERs and power system. Henceforth, this paper focuses on the limitations of intelligent algorithms for DR. Furthermore, a comparative study of different intelligent algorithms for DR is discussed. Based on conclusions, quantum algorithms are recommended to optimize the computational burden for DR in future smartgrid. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 by the authors.

Since legalized services on large number of various applications and system architectures depend on digital signature techniques, in the context some coerced users who use double authentication preventing signatures to design some novel digital signature techniques, have some convincing dissertations to defuse requests from authorities and big brothers creating some corresponding subverted signatures. As rapid progress in quantum computers, National Security Agency advisory memorandum and announcement of National Institute of Standards and Technology procedures from standardization focus on some cryptographic algorithms which are post quantum secure. Motivated by these issues, we design an algorithm substitution attack against Fiat-Shamir family based on lattices (e.g., BLISS, BG, Ring-TESLA, PASSSign and GLP) that are proven post-quantum computational secure. We also show an efficient deterable way to eliminate big brother's threat by leaking signing keys from signatures on two messages to be public. Security proof shows that our schemes satisfy key extraction, undetectability and deterability. Through parameters analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate that our deterring subverted Fiat-Shamir signature is practical, which means that it can be applied to privacy and protection in some system architectures.

(2022),2022,Security Requirements and Challenges of 6G Technologies and Applications,Sensors,10.3390/s22051969,"After implementing 5G technology, academia and industry started researching 6th generation wireless network technology (6G). 6G is expected to be implemented around the year 2030. It will offer a significant experience for everyone by enabling hyper-connectivity between people and everything. In addition, it is expected to extend mobile communication possibilities where earlier generations could not have developed. Several potential technologies are predicted to serve as the foundation of 6G networks. These include upcoming and current technologies such as post-quantum cryptography, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), enhanced edge computing, molecular communication, THz, visible light communication (VLC), and distributed ledger (DL) technologies such as blockchain. From a security and privacy perspective, these developments need a reconsideration of prior security traditional methods. New novel authentication, encryption, access control, communication, and malicious activity detection must satisfy the higher significant requirements of future networks. In addition, new security approaches are necessary to ensure trustworthiness and privacy. This paper provides insights into the critical problems and difficulties related to the security, privacy, and trust issues of 6G networks. Moreover, the standard technologies and security challenges per each technology are clarified. This paper introduces the 6G security architecture and improvements over the 5G architecture. We also introduce the security issues and challenges of the 6G physical layer. In addition, the AI/ML layers and the proposed security solution in each layer are studied. The paper summarizes the security evolution in legacy mobile networks and concludes with their security problems and the most essential 6G application services and their security requirements. Finally, this paper provides a complete discussion of 6G networks' trustworthiness and solutions. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 by the authors.

Aiming at the problems of uncontrollable communication capacity and complex communication process of certain quantum secure direct communication protocols, we propose a three-party quantum secure direct communication (3P-QSDC) protocol with hyperentanglement under polarization and two spatial longitudinal momentum degrees of freedom (DOFs). The secret information of each legitimate user is encoded by using corresponding unitary operations in three degrees of freedom. Compared with previous 3P-QSDC protocols, our protocol has higher information capacity and can reasonably allocate resources to realize adaptive mutual communication of information capacity among three parties. Additionally, the overall analysis indicates that by inserting decoy photons for eavesdropping detection, the proposed protocol has better security, resisting multiple external attacks such as measure-resend and intercept-resend attacks. Our protocol is expected to realize applications with different data transmission capabilities between multiple parties in the future.

While several proof-of-principle experiments of quantum communication using such sources have been realized, most of them required large setupsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âoften involving liquid helium infrastructure or bulky closed-cycle cryotechnology. In this work, we report on the first quantum key distribution (QKD) testbed using a compact benchtop quantum dot single-photon source operating at telecom wavelengths. The plug&play device emits single-photon pulses at O-band wavelengths (1321 nm) and is based on a directly fiber-pigtailed deterministically fabricated quantum dot device integrated into a compact Stirling cryocooler. The Stirling is housed in a 19 in. rack module including all accessories required for stand-alone operation. Implemented in a simple QKD testbed emulating the BB84 protocol with polarization coding, we achieve an multiphoton suppression of g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) = 0.10 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 0.01 and a raw key rate of up to ( 4.72 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 0.13 ) kHz using an external pump laser. In this setting, we further evaluate the performance of our source in terms of the quantum bit error ratios, secure key rates, and tolerable losses expected in full implementations of QKD while accounting for finite key size effects. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal settings for a two-dimensional temporal acceptance window applied on the receiver side, resulting in predicted tolerable losses up to 23.19 dB. Not least, we compare our results with previous proof-of-concept QKD experiments using quantum dot single-photon sources. Our study represents an important step forward in the development of fiber-based quantum-secured communication networks exploiting sub-Poissonian quantum light sources.

Herein, we fabricated a high-speed photoelectric multilevel memory device for neuromorphic computing. The novel two-dimensional (2D) MoSSe with a unique Janus structure was employed as the channel, and the stack of Al2O3/black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs)/Al2O3 was adopted as the dielectric. The storage performance of the resulting memory could be verified by the endurance and retention tests, in which the device could remain stable states of programming and erasing even after 1, 000 cycles and 1, 000 s. The multibit storage could be realized through both different voltage amplitudes and pulse numbers, which could achieve 6 bits (64 distinguishable levels) under pulse width of 50 ns. Furthermore, our memory device also could realize the simulations of synapses in human brain with optical and electric modulations synergistically, such as excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC), long-term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD), and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Neuromorphic computing was successfully achieved through a high recognition of handwritten digits up to 92.5% after 103 epochs. This research is a promising avenue for the future development of efficient memory and artificial neural network systems. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].

94,3,C1,Murali et al. (2022),2022,Toward Systematic Architectural Design of Near-Term Trapped Ion Quantum Computers,Communications of the ACM,10.1145/3511064,"Trapped ions (TIs) are a leading candidate for building Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies, featuring high qubit quality, coherence time, and qubit connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size and typically use a single trap architecture, which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress toward the next major milestone of 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“100 qubit TI devices, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology, and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Toward realizing QCCD-based TI systems with 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“100 qubits, we perform an extensive application-driven architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology, and operation implementation methods. To enable our study, we built a design toolflow, which takes a QCCD architectureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability, and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions. With industry and academic efforts underway to build TI devices with 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“100 qubits, our insights have the potential to influence QC hardware in the near future and accelerate the progress toward practical QC systems.

95,1,C9,Wang et al. (2022),2022,Networking Feasibility of Quantum Key Distribution Constellation Networks,Entropy,10.3390/e24020298,"Quantum key distribution constellation is the key to achieve global quantum networking. However, the networking feasibility of quantum constellation that combines satellite-to-ground accesses selection and inter-satellite routing is faced with a lack of research. In this paper, satelliteto-ground accesses selection is modeled as problems to find the longest paths in directed acyclic graphs. The inter-satellite routing is interpreted as problems to find a maximum flow in graph theory. As far as we know, the above problems are initially understood from the perspective of graph theory. Corresponding algorithms to solve the problems are provided. Although the classical discrete variable quantum key distribution protocol, i.e., BB84 protocol, is applied in simulation, the methods proposed in our paper can also be used to solve other secure key distributions. The simulation results of a low-Earth-orbit constellation scenario show that the Sun is the leading factor in restricting the networking. Due to the solar influence, inter-planar links block the network periodically and, thus, the inter-continental delivery of keys is restricted significantly. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 by the authors.

High bandwidth, extensive coverage, and enhanced capacity are key qualities of IOT networks. The IOT mobile network has two parts: Radio Access Network and Core Network. Toll-free radio access will cover macrocells and towers. The IOT network's macrocells use MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) data transmission. IOT network is a wireless communication to build smart cities. The continuous switching of mega cells necessitates system security. The IoT network has its own communication security. Communication between two users will need frequent cell hopping. To improve network security, AES DES are utilised. QKD Algorithm is utilised to encrypt and decrypt in the proposed technique. Quantum computation uses superposition and entanglement to solve problems. This secures quantum computers. The QKD algorithm encrypts and decrypts data in Rectilinear and Diagonal bases utilising randomness. The qubits are transmitted. Encryption is done by turning qubits into photons. The QKD employs symmetric key encryption for authentication and confidentiality. Quantum key exchange delivers secure symmetric secret keys using a public key protocol for all network users. The performance indicators are compared to existing algorithms.

97,2,C2,Hedhli et al. (2022),2022,Predictive BPaaS management with quantum and neural computing,Journal of Software: Evolution and Process,10.1002/smr.2421,"With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, the deployment and management of business processes over cloud environments have become an essential operation for most enterprises, leading to the emergence of BPaaS (Business Process as a Service) as a new cloud service model. This SaaS-like service, like its ancestors, should be strategically distributed and managed over multiple cloud zones, while taking into account several constraints and conditions (e.g., sensitivity of BPaaS fragments, insecure and untrusted cloud zones, lack of resources, and workload changes). However, current BPaaS approaches are static, which means that they are no longer suitable to manage such enterprise-oriented cloud service model and to deal with the uncertain and dynamic nature of cloud availability zones. To fill this gap, we adopt a predictive BPaaS management strategy by proposing a model that forecasts the next-short time overload of cloud zones. These latter, as hosting environments for the managed BPaaS, are categorized as overloaded or underloaded, which triggers the migration of BPaaS fragments to high-performance cloud zones. The proposed neural network prediction model (called QGA-NN) is enhanced with a quantum genetic algorithm to optimize the prediction of cloud zones' overload. QGA-NN is evaluated using a BPaaS placement algorithm, which we defined as a triggered management operation. Experimental results have proved the accuracy and effectiveness of our predictive approach, compared with state-of-the-art solutions.

(2022),2022,On the quantum performance evaluation of two distributed quantum architectures,Performance Evaluation,10.1016/j.peva.2021.102242,"Distributed quantum applications impose requirements on the quality of the quantum states that they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations of quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in understanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum hardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and traditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world implementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades the quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two possible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum network. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in which the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The second corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions over two distinct devices. We model these architectures as continuous-time Markov chains and compare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled quantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that it takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an illustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for present-day device parameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications, and the other for network-heavy ones. We validate our analysis with the quantum network simulator NetSquid. Besides the detailed study of these architectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that connect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum quality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum technologies. This provides a valuable new tool for performance evaluation experts, and its applications extend beyond the two architectures studied in this work.

After its initial design, compatibility tests with legacy L-band systems, and functional demonstrations in the laboratory, the system is currently undergoing the standardization process of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, LDACS has not been demonstrated in flight yet. In this article, we present the first in-flight demonstration of LDACS, which took place in March and April 2019 in southern Germany and included four LDACS ground stations and one LDACS airborne station. We detail the experimental setup of the implemented LDACS ground and airborne stations together with the flight routes, the conducted experiments, and the frequency planning to ensure compatibility with legacy systems. In addition, we describe the demonstrated ATM applications and the security measures used to protect them. Based on the obtained measurement results, we evaluate the LDACS in-flight communication performance for the first time, including the achieved communication range, the measured end-to-end message latency, and the LDACS capability to provide quality of service by effectively prioritizing safety-relevant data traffic. Furthermore, we use the in-flight received signal power to assess the applicability of a theoretical path loss model. These flight trials contribute to the final steps in the development of LDACS by providing its in-flight communication performance and by demonstrating: first, its correct functionality in a realistic environment; second, its capability of supporting ATM applications and the advanced security measures that can be used to protect them; and third, its spectrum compatibility with legacy systems. We conclude that LDACS is ready to support ATM operations and that LDACS frequency planning can safeguard legacy systems successfully.

(2022),2022,"Task Allocation among Connected Devices: Requirements, Approaches, and Challenges",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3127314,"Task allocation (TA) is essential when deploying application tasks to systems of connected devices with dissimilar and time-varying characteristics. The challenge of an efficient TA is to assign the tasks to the best devices, according to the context and task requirements. The main purpose of this article is to study the different connotations of the concept of TA efficiency, and the key factors that most impact on it, so that relevant design guidelines can be defined. This article first analyzes the domains of connected devices where TA has an important role, which brings to this classification: 1) Internet of Things (IoT); 2) sensor and actuator networks (SANs); 3) multirobot systems (MRSs); 4) mobile crowdsensing (MCS); and 5) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This article then demonstrates that the impact of the key factors on the domains actually affects the design choices of the state-of-the-art TA solutions. It results that resource management has most significantly driven the design of TA algorithms in all domains, especially IoT and SAN. The fulfillment of coverage requirements is important for the definition of TA solutions in MCS and UAV. Quality of Information requirements are mostly included in MCS TA strategies, similar to the design of appropriate incentives. This article also discusses the issues that need to be addressed by future research activities, i.e., allowing interoperability of platforms in the implementation of TA functionalities; introducing appropriate trust evaluation algorithms; the list of tasks performed by objects; and designing TA strategies where network service providers have a role in TA functionalities' provisioning.

The destructive use of quantum steganography methods to establish illegal covert communications is rising, so it is essential to introduce ways to detect hidden data in a quantum medium. Accordingly, this paper presents a frequency-based universal audio steganalysis approach to detecting quantum steganography. First, based on the quantum Fourier transform, the characteristic of the quantum spectrum centroid (QSC) was computed, and its circuit network was implemented to extract feature vectors. The proposed method classifies quantum audio signals using a quantum machine learning approach called a quantum ensemble of quantum classifiers. This approach was implemented within the framework of the DeutschÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jozsa algorithm, which uses the superposition property to create an ensemble of classifiers evaluated in parallel, significantly increasing the computational speed. The accuracy weight of the classifiers is adjusted based on the classifiers' performance in training data classification; finally, the measurement of the first n qubits of the DeutschÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jozsa algorithm predicts whether the quantum audio signals belong to the stego or clean class. The idea stems from the classic ensemble methods that try to build more robust models by combining different classifiers. The results show that the proposed frequency domain steganalysis method with 95% accuracy performs better than the previous methods in the time domain.

In this paper, based on the Quantum Weak Measurement theory (QWM), we propose an interpretable network with complex-valued representation to deal with the insufficient interpretability of FNNs and the Semantic Interpretability of Complex Numbers (SICN) from a novel perspective. For the specific role of complex-valued representation in capturing semantic information, we give an in-depth analysis that the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers can simultaneously represent two different types of complementary information. Finally, we propose a QWM inspired interpretable Network for text representation learning (i.e., QWMN) and implement two frameworks for Question Answering (QWMN-QA) and Text Classification (QWMN-TC) respectively.

Classification of a brain MR image for detection of tumour regions is a widely performed diagnostic step when it comes to working with brain images. Classical machine learning methods and/or conventional deep learning architectures including convolutional nets are commonly used for the classification of images. With larger network size, training the model becomes a challenging task to undertake. Quantum algorithms are beneficial in optimizing the performance of classical algorithms by incorporating intrinsic properties of quantum bits. In this paper, a novel Quantum Classical ConvNet architecture (QCCNN) is proposed for a binary class classification of brain MR images for detection of tumour regions in the human brain. The underlying idea is to encode data into quantum states enabling a faster extraction of information followed by using the information to distinguish the class of data. The reliability and the robustness of the proposed architecture are highlighted by the results obtained by the classifier. With technological advancements in quantum computers in the future (more qubits and less noise), the performance of the approach can be further improved. The presented model is tested on various datasets (Brats 2013, Harvard Med School, private dataset) and on quantitative evaluation with standard metrics, and the robustness of the classifier is verified. The proposed QCCNN model achieves accuracies in the range of 97.5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“98.72% on different datasets which defend the ability of the presented architecture in detecting and classifying brain tumours.

(2022),2022,Non-trivial symmetries in quantum landscapes and their resilience to quantum noise,Quantum,10.22331/Q-2022-09-15-804,"Very little is known about the cost landscape for Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quantum Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum advantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Recent works have focused on quantum-aware optimizers specifically tailored for PQCs. However, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such optimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs: (1) We find an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large degeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast as an exponential reduction in the volume of relevant hyperparameter space. (2) We study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it is conserved under unital noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries and lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based on these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based Minima Hopping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our numerical simulations show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance in the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware. Overall, this work derives large-scale circuit symmetries from local gate transformations, and uses them to construct a noise-aware optimization method. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 Quantum.

However, current protocols of pure-state informationally-complete (PS-IC) measurement settings generally involve various multi-qubit gates or complex quantum algorithms, which are not practical for large systems. In this study, we present an adaptive approach to N-qubit pure-state tomography with Pauli measurements. First, projective measurements on each qubit in the Z-direction were implemented to determine the amplitude of each base of the target state. Then, a set of Pauli measurement settings was recursively deduced by the Z-measurement results, which can be used to determine the phase of each base. The number of required measurement settings is O(N) for certain quantum states, including cluster and W states. Finally, we numerically verified the feasibility of our strategy by reconstructing a 1-D chain state using a neural network algorithm.

Numerous decentralized blockchain applications have been possible due to blockchains' nature of distributed, secured, and peer-to-peer storage. One of its technical pillars is using public-key cryptography and hash functions, which promise a secure, pseudoanonymous, and distributed storage with nonrepudiation. This security is believed to be difficult to break with classical computational powers. However, recent advances in quantum computing have raised the possibility of breaking these algorithms with quantum computers, thus, threatening the blockchains' security. Quantum-resistant blockchains are being proposed as alternatives to resolve this issue. Some propose to replace traditional cryptography with postquantum cryptography-others base their approaches on quantum computer networks or quantum internets. Nonetheless, a new security infrastructure (e.g., access control/authentication) must be established before any of these could happen. This article provides a theoretical analysis of the quantum blockchain technologies that could be used for decentralized identity authentication. We put together a conceptual design for a quantum blockchain identity framework and give a review of the technical evidence. We investigate its essential components and feasibility, effectiveness, and limitations. Even though it currently has various limitations and challenges, we believe a decentralized perspective of quantum applications is noteworthy and likely.

Based on the analysis of the optical characteristics of the seawater channel, an underwater access model of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution is constructed, simulated and analyzed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme. The simulation results show that the maximum secure access distance of the scheme (under extreme conditions) can be extended from 147 meters to 230 meters or even 451 meters as the seawater type changes from turbid seawater to moderately turbid seawater to clear seawater. The vacuum + weak decoy state scheme can obtain performance that is very close to this limit. After considering the effect of finite data-set size, the performance of the scheme is reduced, but it can still meet the application requirements of underwater mobile platform access within a certain range. In practical applications, measures such as deploying wired communication buoys at network nodes can be used to further expand the effective access range.

Researchers have formulated and executed a plethora of bug forecasting methodologies by computing the performance in terms of precision and difficulty. Various statistical models are established in the literature to observe bug existence and restoring method; these models are termed software reliability growth models. The existence of bugs in software is primarily because of the constant variations in the software code. Open source software is prevalent amongst academicians and has found users in big businesses. OSS is extremely effective, but source code variations have to be made regularly through the progressively advanced requirement at the userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s end. The open source group is expanding rapidly, and numerous categories of provisions are offered. Stakeholders contribute to OSS in business by reinforcing the value of schemes, taking into account great revenue earnings and novel scheme expansion. An essential feature of open source software is determining when to issue a novel form. The principal goal is to announce the software at a suitable time with minimal economic restrictions. The approach after announcing software is a challenge and announcement development performs a vital function in handling effective announcements to clients. It is essentially a group of novel characteristics that are combined to form an invention setting. The primary announcement is just after the expansion procedure and additional consequent announcements are founded upon the preceding announcements, number of prerequisites, and faults restored. Each announcement incorporates a collection of characteristics fulfilling particular restrictions of the corporation as required by the customers. Forming conclusions about what characteristics are to be encompassed in which announcement is a tiresome job. Information theory, which deals with computation and communication of knowledge around a network, was primarily invented by Claude E Shannon. It is a probabilistic established method that emphasizes the computation of vagueness associating data. It has widespread prospective functions in areas including model recognition, statistical interpretation, natural language processing, thermal physics, quantum computing, etc. Entropy is a significant subdivision of information theory that performs a principal function in examining the code change procedure. It is a quantity of uncertainty/difficulty of code change and portrays the quantity of information covered in an event. In this chapter, a method of captivating the number of faults documented in numerous announcements of Bugzilla software is established and distinctive amounts of entropy for the alterations in various software, which informs these intervals, are computed. Initially simple linear regression is employed to envisage faults that are expected to occur in the future. By means of anticipated faults and entropy measures in multiple linear regression, the announcement period of the software has been forecast. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

It is a potential candidate for application in Sixth-Generation (6G) 6GSixth-Generation wireless networks, as it has the capabilities of satisfying the high data rate and capacity requirements of future wireless communication systems. Profound knowledge of the propagation channel is crucial in communication systems design, which nonetheless is still at its infancy, as channel modeling at THz frequencies has been mostly limited to characterizing fixed Point-to-Point (PtP) scenarios up to 300 GHz. Provided the technology matures enough and models adapt to the distinctive characteristics of the THz wave, future wireless communication systems will enable a plethora of new use cases and applications to be realized, in addition to delivering higher spectral efficiencies that would ultimately enhance the Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the end user. In this paper, we provide an insight into THz channel propagation characteristics, measurement capabilities, and modeling techniques for 6G communication applications, along with guidelines and recommendations that will aid future characterization efforts in the THz band. We survey the most recent and important measurement campaigns and modeling efforts found in literature, based on the use cases and system requirements identified. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of measurement and modeling at such high frequencies and contemplate the future research outlook toward realizing the 6G vision.

In this scenario, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be employed to enhance the capacity of quantum information processing and to distribute quantum entanglement in an efficient and scalable way with multiple users. Here, a method for realizing a multiplexed continuous variable (CV) quantum entanglement distribution based on a four-wave mixing process combined with an active routing technique is experimentally demonstrated. By exploiting Sagnac-based OAM sorters, the OAM entanglement can be distributed and measured with the different users in a quasi-complete star network configuration. The generations of multiple sets of OAM multiplexed bipartite CV entanglement with four users and six users are proposed and demonstrated here. In addition, the propagation of one mode through a 1 km of single-mode fiber shows the applicability of this approach. These results propose and demonstrate a new method for distributing CV entanglement in a quantum network enlarging the range of applicability of CV quantum informationÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â protocols.

Consideration should be given to the unique physical properties of quantum. In quantum networks with relatively limited resources (such as quantum memory), decoherence will lead to qubits loss, which restricts the time that data qubits can be stored in memory before use. Therefore, transmitting data qubits as soon as possible is very important to realize the network function. In order to ensure timeliness, this paper proposes a multipath concurrent entanglement routing scheme based on virtual circuit in quantum networks. Compared with the single path method, this scheme has obvious advantages in reducing the time required to establish the quantum entanglement channel and to transmit the measurement outcomes.

The acceleration can be boosted by pooling compute infrastructures to either parallelize algorithm execution or solve bigger instances that are not feasible on a single quantum computer, which requires an underlying Quantum Internet: the interconnection of quantum computers by quantum links and repeaters to exchange entangled quantum bits. However, Quantum Internet research so far has been focused on provisioning point-to-point flows only, which is suitable for (e.g.) quantum sensing and metrology, but not for distributed quantum computing. In this paper, after a primer on quantum computing and networking, we investigate the requirements and objectives of smart computing on distributed nodes from the perspective of quantum network provisioning. We then design a resource allocation strategy that is evaluated through a comprehensive simulation campaign, whose results highlight the key features and performance issues, and lead the way to further investigation in this direction.

Recently, with the rapid development of quantum computers, quantum-inspired optimization and machine learning algorithms have been exploited as efficient solutions for future wireless networks. In this article, we provide a comprehensive view on the new concept of quantum-inspired RTO and its application to the optimal resource allocation for 6G wireless networks. Our main contributions are to introduce some of the initial research results and introduce the potentiality of quantum-inspired RTO on some 6G emerging technologies.

To mitigate the market risks and make the best of investments, predicting the movement of stock index futures is considered significant to ensure the potential gain in futures market trading. However, the accurate and precise prediction is not easy to obtain in the financial data which normally have high fluctuation. While the conventional econometric methods for forecasting require many assumptions, the machine learning models generally involve complex and unintelligible rules as well as a complicated network structure. In addition, the machine learning model itself did not guarantee a global optimum solution. It easily falls to the local optimum answer that directly affects the model's predicted value accuracy. To handle these drawbacks, in this study, we propose using a novel hybrid Wavelet Transformation-Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WT-QPSO-ANFIS) model to forecast stock index futures. Generally speaking, three approaches, Wavelet Transformation (WT), Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), are combined in our forecasting model. The result reveals that the hybrid WT-QPSO-ANFIS model provides higher efficiency and accuracy in predicting all 11 stock index futures considered in this study compared to the conventional Sugeno-type ANFIS model, ANN model and ARIMA model in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Standard Error of Mean (SEM).

(2022),2022,An Evolutionary Pathway for the Quantum Internet Relying on Secure Classical Repeaters,IEEE Network,10.1109/MNET.108.2100375,"Until quantum repeaters become mature, quantum networks remain restricted either to limited areas of directly connected nodes or to nodes connected to a common node. We circumvent this limitation by conceiving quantum networks using secure classical repeaters combined with the quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) principle, which is a compelling form of quantum communication that directly transmits information over a quantum channel. The final component of this promising solution is our classical quantum-resistant algorithm. Explicitly, in these networks, the ciphertext gleaned from a quantum-resistant algorithm is transmitted using QSDC along the nodes, where it is read out by one node and then transmitted to the next node. At the repeaters, the information is protected by our quantum-resistant algorithm, which is secure even in the face of a quantum computer. Hence, our solution offers secure end-to-end communication across the entire network, since it is capable of both eavesdropping detection and prevention in the emerging quantum Internet. It is compatible with operational networks, and will enjoy the compelling services of the popular Internet, including authentication. Hence, it smoothens the transition from the classical Internet to the quantum Internet (Qinternet) by following a gradual evolutionary upgrade. It will act as an alternative network in quantum computing networks in the future. We have presented the first experimental demonstration of a secure classical-repeater-based hybrid quantum network constructed by a serial concatenation of an optical fiber and free-space communication link. In conclusion, secure repeater networks may indeed be constructed using existing technology and continue to support a seamless evolutionary pathway to the future Qinternet of quantum computers.

Those security issues need to be mitigated for securing 6G networks from existing challenges. Classical cryptography will not remain enough for securing the 6G network. As all classical cryptography can be disabled with the help of quantum mechanics. Therefore, in the place of traditional security solutions, in this article, we have reviewed all the existing quantum solutions of 5G existing security issues to mitigate them and secure 6G in a Future Quantum World.

The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is currently working on the 5G New Radio, also known as the worldwide standardization of 5G, which can operate across a wide variety of frequency bands from minus than 6GHz to mmWave (100GHz). Nonetheless, 5G will not be able to satisfy all requirements for the foreseeable future. Hence, Beyond 5G (B5G) and Sixth Generation (6G) have emerged as concepts representing Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs). B5G and 6G networks will probably integrate Artificial intelligence-based services, tactile services, hybrid access, quantum computing, edge computing, and optical wireless communication. This paper describes potential background concepts relating to Network Slicing and artificial intelligence. We present the literature review by studying the impact of Artificial Intelligence with its promising methods, training models, and architectures to be integrated into B5G Network slicing to perform Resource Management.

130,3,C1,Heinonen et al. (2022),2022,A Survey on Technologies Which Make Bitcoin Greener or More Justified,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190891,"According to recent estimates, one bitcoin transaction consumes as much energy as 1.5 million Visa transactions. Why is bitcoin using so much energy? Most of the energy is used during the bitcoin mining process, which serves at least two significant purposes: a) distributing new cryptocurrency coins to the cryptoeconomy and b) securing the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. In reality, the comparison of bitcoin transactions to Visa transactions is not that simple. The amount of transactions in the Bitcoin network is not directly connected to the amount of bitcoin mining power nor the energy consumption of those mining devices; for example, it is possible to multiply the number of bitcoin transactions per second without increasing the mining power and the energy consumption. Bitcoin is not only 'digital money for hackers'. It has very promising future potential as a global reserve currency and a method to make the World Wide Web (WWW) immune to cyberattacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks. This survey approached cryptocurrencies' various technological and environmental issues from many different perspectives. To make various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), greener and more justified, what technological solutions do we have? We found that cryptocurrency mining might be cleaner than is generally expected. There is also a plan to make a vast renewable energy source available by combining Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and Bitcoin mining. There are plans to use unconventional computing methods (quantum computing, reversible computing, ternary computing, optical computing, analog computing) to solve some of the issues regarding the vast energy consumption of conventional computing (including cryptocurrency mining). We think using spare computing cycles for grid computing efforts is justified. For example, there are billions of smartphones in the world. Many smartphones are being recharged every day. If this daily recharging period of twenty to sixty minutes would be used for grid computing, for example, finding new cures to cancer, it would probably be a significant breakthrough for medical research simulations. We call cryptocurrency communities to research and develop grid computing and unconventional computing methods for the most significant cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).

Classical mix-net implementations rely on standard public key primitives (e.g. ElGamal encryption) that will become vulnerable when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer will be built. Thus, there is a need to develop quantum-resistant mix-nets. This paper focuses on the application case of electronic voting where the number of votes to be mixed may reach hundreds of thousands or even millions. We propose an improved architecture for lattice-based post-quantum mix-nets featuring more efficient zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining established security assumptions. Our current implementation scales up to 100000 votes, still leaving a lot of room for future optimisation.

Its applications in computational quantum mechanical modeling have inspired promising development in HER catalyst scrutiny and screening. The present communication reviews the general scheme of ML, data sources, and computational tools for HER catalyst screening and therefore provides a strong basis for its application.

To the point that it is already generating interest in the scientific and industrial communities. Currently, quantum computers and technology are being developed to support the execution of quantum software. Several large computer companies have already built functional quantum computers, and developed several programming languages and quantum simulators that can be used by the general public. All this infrastructure for quantum computing is offered to quantum developers through the cloud, following a model similar to the familiar Infrastructure as a Service. However, due to the early stages of quantum computing taking advantage of the capabilities of these computers requires a very in depth knowledge of quantum programming and quantum hardware that is far from what cloud developers are used to in classical cloud offerings. Although the future of quantum computing is still unknown, it is highly certain that there must be a time when quantum computing coexists with classical computing. At the same time, one of the most well-known and tested solutions for the communication of heterogeneous computing systems are web services. In this tutorial we will offer an introductory view on how quantum algorithms can be converted into web services, how this web services can be deployed, using the Amazon Braket platform for quantum computing, and invoked through classical web services endpoints. Finally, we will propose a way in which a disadvantage of current quantum computers in terms of web services can be transformed into an advantage for web services through the use of a Quantum API Gateway.

In quantum this bit of data is represented by a single atom qubit. Qubits utilizes two states and the superposition of these two states and its quantum correlations. In Quantum mechanics the qubits work together to solve a particular problem. The quantum superposition and entanglement principle gives qubits the ability to perform with much faster computations than bits in classical computers. Quantum computers are disrupting every industry. They can solve problems that are intractable for current classical computers. This is the reason for increasing investment by Government and players like Google, Microsoft and IBM, in recent past.

The growth of IoT and the increasing need for automation have led to an exciting application in the transportation industry, namely the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Simply put, IoV systems are vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) enhanced by integrating them with automation over the internet. As briefly discussed in this paper, the IoV systems guarantee various advantages like a much safer and more efficient future. However, the primary challenge at hand is implementing IoV at the end-user level. Of the varied building blocks present on the road to the development of IoV, secure data transfer is an essential requirement, especially with recent advances in quantum computing. IOTA is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) specifically designed to secure IoT data transmissions. This paper discusses the advantages of implementing IOTA for secure and private IoV systems. The paper suggests replacing IOTA's current post-quantum signature scheme Winternitz One Time Signature (W-OTS) with CRYSTALS Dilithium. These two post-quantum signature schemes are evaluated against each other to establish that employing Dilithium reduces both latency and signature space required, bringing a significant improvement to IOTA. This improvisation is beneficial, especially for the fast-paced functioning of IoV environments.

This paper proposes a cell-attachment procedure, which establishes a secure LDACS communication channel between an aircraft and corresponding ground-station upon cell-entry of the aircraft. Via the design of a hybrid LDACS Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the choice of a pre-or post-quantum Security Level (SL) is up to the communications participants. With that, this work introduces a full LDACS cell-attachment protocol based on a PKI, certificates, certificate revocation and cipher-suites including pre-and post-quantum options. Evaluations in the symbolic model show the procedure to fulfill LDACS security requirements and a communications performance evaluation demonstrates feasibility, matching requirements imposed by regulatory documents.

(2022),2022,A Modified Key Sifting Scheme with Artificial Neural Network Based Key Reconciliation Analysis in Quantum Cryptography,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3188798,"Quantum Cryptography emerged from the limitations of classical cryptography. It will play a vital role in information security after the availability of expected powerful quantum computers. Still many quantum primitives like quantum money, blind quantum computation, quantum copy protection, etc. are theoretical as they require a completely functional quantum computer for their implementation. But one prominent quantum cryptographic primitive, the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is possible with current technology. The QKD is a key establishment system having several stages namely raw key generation, key sifting, key reconciliation, and privacy amplification. In this paper, an efficient key sifting scheme has been developed. Successful simulation has shown that the proposed modified key sifting scheme requires less time to build the sifted key compared to the sifted key in conventional BB84 protocol in most cases. This paper also represents Tree Parity Machine (TPM) based key reconciliation analysis using different learning algorithms such as Hebbian, Anti-Hebbian, and Random-Walk. This reconciliation analysis helps to choose the optimum learning algorithm for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based key reconciliation in future Quantum Key Distribution systems.

In parallel, the first quantum computing devices have become available, paving the way for a new paradigm in information processing. Data representation is important for machine learning models. High-dimensional data can be converted to low dimensional codes efficiently by an artificial neural network. Due to quantum properties, a quantum algorithm can also perform this task, leaving only the neural network to perform the classification. In this paper, a quantum angle encoding algorithm is used to encode the vibration data into a binary representation, leaving the artificial neural networks for the classification. The vibration data in converted by applying a rotation on each of the Bloch sphere axes (X, Y and Z). After the rotation is performed, a measurement is made, collapsing the state into a single binary representation (0 or 1). Using the original and the converted data, multiple artificial neural networks topologies were trained to classify the data.

The development of quantum computers (QCs) and their potential to utilize ShorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Law, is increasingly recognized as a threat to asymmetric cryptography. In response, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is gaining prominence as a notable field of research aiming to standardize quantum resistant algorithms before the operational usage of QCs. This paper is addressed to people with preliminary knowledge in the field of cryptography and QC. Based on a literature review, the authors provide an overview of challenges faced by the research community and elaborate the advancements in addressing post-quantum threats. A migration strategy from classical cryptosystems to PQC systems is in development, but obstacles such as time constraints and improper implementation complicate the process. Full implementation could take a decade or more. Until then, our paper aims to create awareness for potential challenges when transitioning towards PQC. As categorization scheme for these potential obstacles, we refer to a well-established model in cybersecurity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the McCumber Cube. Conclusions embrace preparing for risks of improper implementation and deriving a multi-step migration. Special attention is expected to be needed for data migration of existing data sets. As a request for future research in PQC, the authors identified the process of implementing post-cryptography standards, e.g., from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and an assessment of the perceived readiness of industry to adapt.

In this study, the statistical function predicts the system performance of the future timestamp and compares it with the actual performance to detect the attack. The asymmetric encryption function is used to find the user authentication, which is complex and increases the network latency. In this paper, a blockchain-based methodology is proposed for cybersecurity threat detection in smart grid networks without increasing the network latency. The proposed model is based on blockchain-based secure user authentication, lightweight data encryption and quantum key distribution multi-constraint-based edge selection, bi-fold intrusion detection system, and optimal user privacy management. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed model is 98%.

Efficient usage of resources and reliable operations are key objectives for network management. Optimization plays a pivotal role to make the best decisions in limited time. To tackle such difficult and elaborate (typically NP-hard) computational problems the latest developments in Quantum Computing are coming into focus. Successes with models for road traffic, logistics or financial industry have already demonstrated the applicability of these new methods to real-world problems. In this paper we formulate a model for resource assignment for transporting data over networks. For applicability in existing network management environments the model was designed on top of Segment Routing (SR) concepts. The validity of the model is proven for different cost and reliability targets. Based on a Digital Annealer (DA) as quantum-inspired hardware and an appropriate decomposition approach realistic data sets of a tier-1 provider can be processed. The quality of the results is comparable to classical optimization methods while the new approaches outperform those in computation time and have potential for a higher number of demands. An end-to-end comparison of quadratic model creation and solving on large data sets versus a processing as linear integer problem is presented. This shows that quantum approaches and algorithms are not only a preparation for a more distant future of fully functional quantum computers but can generate business advantages even today.

Quantum Cryptography provides unconditional security to the data which were transmitted. Quantum Cryptography uses two channels for communication - a classical channel and a quantum channel. However, authentication in the classical channel is currently done by the classical cryptographic algorithms that are not efficient and quantum-safe. In addition to that, the existing QKD schemes do not ensure confidentiality to the data transmitted through the classical channel. PostQuantum Cryptography(PQC) is a computational-security based cryptographic technique that is quantum-resistant. So, as a solution to the authentication and encryption inefficiencies in the classical channel, PQC can be used. Here we are proposing an Authenticated-Encryption Scheme in the classical channel using the PQC algorithms Falcon and NTRU that are Quantum safe.

The article considers topical issues of interconnection of life cycles of business, production, product models of enterprises and key indicators of their activities through the prism of the evolution of information systems, their impact on the pace of development of enterprises and the role that information systems play in industrial revolutions. Objective. The overall objective of the study is to assess the impact of information systems on the development of enterprises in the process of industrial revolutions by assessing the key performance indicators covering all perspectives (functional areas of enterprise development) of the balanced scorecard as one of the progressive systems of strategic management of organizations. Method. Formalization of key performance indicators through the mathematical apparatus was carried out using the methodology of strategic management of the enterprise - the balanced scorecard. Results. The study formalized the types of basic IS and software, their impact on the development processes of enterprises during the industrial revolutions by assessing certain key performance indicators in terms of the balanced scorecard methodology, which was first described using a mathematical apparatus. Conclusions. The main directions of transformation of modern production are defined by three global technological trends: network integration, intellectualization and flexible automation. The development and widespread implementation of IP has doubled the pace of technological revolutions and, in fact, determines all further enterprise development strategies within these technological trends. The next (fifth) industrial revolution will be defined exclusively by the development of data science and the transition to new system architectures of computing systems or their combinations, for example using neurosynaptic and quantum computers, which will allow using all the possibilities of industrial Internet of Things and Digital twinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concepts in almost real time.

In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has been gaining traction as a possible application of quantum computing which may provide quantum advantage in the future. However, quantum versions of classical machine learning algorithms introduce a plethora of additional parameters and circuit variations that have their own intricacies in being tuned.In this work, we take the first steps towards Automated Quantum Machine Learning (AutoQML).

(2022),2022,Improved Harris Hawks Optimization algorithm based on quantum correction and Nelder-Mead simplex method,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,10.3934/mbe.2022358,"Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is a kind of intelligent algorithm that simulates the predation behavior of hawks. It suffers several shortcomings, such as low calculation accuracy, easy to fall into local optima and difficult to balance exploration and exploitation. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes an improved HHO algorithm named as QC-HHO. Firstly, the initial population is generated by HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©non Chaotic Map to enhance the randomness and ergodicity. Secondly, the quantum correction mechanism is introduced in the local search phase to improve optimization accuracy and population diversity. Thirdly, the Nelder-Mead simplex method is used to improve the search performance and breadth. Fourthly, group communication factors describing the relationship between individuals is taken into consideration. Finally, the energy consumption law is integrated into the renewal process of escape energy factor E and jump distance J to balance exploration and exploitation. The QC-HHO is tested on 10 classical benchmark functions and 30 CEC2014 benchmark functions. The results show that it is superior to original HHO algorithm and other improved HHO algorithms. At the same time, the improved algorithm studied in this paper is applied to gas leakage source localization by wireless sensor networks. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of position and gas release rate are excellent, which verifies the feasibility for application of QC-HHO in practice.

When adopting a QEC scheme based on surface codes, error decoding is the most computationally expensive task in the classical electronic back-end. Decoders employing neural networks (NN) are well-suited for this task but their hardware implementation has not been presented yet. This work presents a space exploration of fully connected feed-forward NN decoders for small distance surface codes. The goal is to optimize the NN for the high-decoding performance, while keeping a minimalistic hardware implementation. This is needed to meet the tight delay constraints of real-time surface code decoding. We demonstrate that hardware-based NN-decoders can achieve the high-decoding performance comparable to other state-of-the-art decoding algorithms whilst being well below the tight delay requirements (\approx 440\ ns) of current solid-state qubit technologies for both application-specific integrated circuit designs (< \!30\ ns) and field-programmable gate array implementations (<\! 90\ ns). These results indicate that NN-decoders are viable candidates for further exploration of an integrated hardware implementation in future large-scale quantum computers.

It is essential in the software development process and needs a huge quantity of resources such as labor, money, and time. Automated software testing can be used to save manual work, shorten testing times, and improve testing performance. Recently, Software Bug Prediction (SBP) models have been developed to improve the software quality assurance (SQA) process through the prediction of bug parts. Advanced deep learning (DL) models can be used to classify faults in software parts. Because hyperparameters have a significant impact on the performance of any DL model, a proper hyperparameter optimization approach utilizing metaheuristic methods is required. This paper provides a unique Metaheuristic Optimization with Deep Learning based SBP (MODL-SBP) methodology to ensure software dependability and trustworthiness. The suggested technique entails creating a hybrid Convolution Neural Network (CNN) bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to forecast software pro-blems. Furthermore, the Chaotic Quantum Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CQGOA) is used for hyperparameter optimization of the CNN-BiLSTM models, which enhances predictive accuracy. To demonstrate the superior performance of the MODL-SBP technique, a wide range of simulations are performed on benchmark datasets, with the results highlighting the superior performance of the proposed model over other recent techniques.

The strategy of Benders' decomposition can be described as a strategy of divide and conquer. The Benders' decomposition algorithm has been employed in a variety of applications such as communication, networking, and machine learning. However, the master problem in Benders' decomposition is still NP-hard, which motivates us to employ quantum computing. In the paper, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition algorithm. We transfer the Benders' decomposition's master problem into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and solve it by the state-of-the-art quantum annealer. Then, we analyze the computational results and discuss the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Due to our reformulation in the master problem in Benders' decomposition, our hybrid algorithm, which takes advantage of both classical and quantum computers, can guarantee the solution quality for solving MILP problems.

Unfortunately, slicing inherits many of the security challenges of cloud and edge computing such as side-channel information leakage, while also encountering new challenges posed by multi-domain authorization and quantum computing. Many extant mechanisms, such as PKI, are insufficient in the face of quantum computers, and existing side-channel mitigations impose heavy overhead costs while only providing defense against known attacks. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to protecting slice control information through the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). HE allows quantum-resilient validation and distribution of critical information, while also enabling hierarchical control across multiple domains and providing encrypted computation. Further, threshold HE enables secure decryption and computation of control or measurement information, while protecting the entire slice against potential key-leakage by rendering any one key useless without the required quorum. The benchmark results shown demonstrate that the HE mechanisms used can be deployed in a practical manner, providing stalwart security guarantees against a variety of threats.

Nevertheless, these research and standardisation efforts are proceeding in parallel, without any significant interaction. Thus, it is essential to discuss an architecture and the possible protocol stack for classical-quantum communication networks, allowing for an effective integration between quantum and classical networks. The main scope of this paper is to provide a joint architecture for quantum-classical communication networks, considering the very recent advancements in the architectural design of 6G and the quantum internet, also defining guidelines and characteristics, which can be helpful for the ongoing standardisation efforts. For this purpose, the article discusses some of the existing main standardisation processes in classical communications and proposed protocol stacks for quantum communications. This aims at highlighting the potential points of connection and the differences that may imply future incompatible developments.

Wind power has dominated among various renewable sources due to the widespread availability and advanced low-cost technologies. However, the stochastic nature of wind power results in power system reliability and security issues. This is because the uncertain variability of wind power results in challenges to various system operations such as unit commitment and economic dispatch. Such problems can be addressed by accurate wind power forecasts to great extent. This attracted wider investigations for obtaining accurate power forecasts using various forecasting models such as time series, machine learning, probabilistic, and hybrid. These models use different types of inputs and obtain forecasts in different time horizons, and have different applications. Also, different investigations represent forecasting performance using different performance metrics. Limited classification reviews are available for these areas and detailed classification on these areas will help researchers and system operators to develop new accurate forecasting models. Therefore, this paper proposes a detailed review of those areas. It concludes that even though quantum investigations are available, wind power forecasting accuracy improvement is an ever-existing research problem. Also, forecasting performance indication in financial term such as deviation charges can be used to represent the economic impact of forecasting accuracy improvement.

First of all, to alleviate the impact of the uncertainty of photovoltaic output on the management of microgrids, an improved deep learning model (QPSO-LSTM) based on the quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm long short-term memory network was developed to predict photovoltaic power output. Secondly, according to the forecast results, a day-ahead load optimization dispatching model for grid-connected microgrid based on non-dominated sequencing genetic algorithm and elite strategy (NSGA-II) algorithm is proposed. The microgrid includes photovoltaic systems, energy storage systems and diesel generators. We use data sets collected in the real world to test the established models. The final results show that the performance of the QPSO-LSTM model is better than the PSO-LSTM model and the LSTM model. Actual data have also verified the feasibility and efficiency of the energy management model.

This implies that the satellite will be necessary for the transmission of quantum keys in order to avoid these terrestrial limitations. Therefore, the current debate does not lie in the need for the satellite but rather in what type of infrastructure will be best suited, and specifically the usage of GEO vs LEO satellites. This analysis is not trivial and should not consider only the link budgets and the physical layer as it has been done up to date. It should also consider even more important factors, as the service KPIs that the end user will request such as key rate, availability, security of the keys and their maintenance, etc., as well as the possible communications architectures to provide the service. Therefore, the analysis should introduce the market oriented component, and provide the optimal solutions based on the scenarios and requirements requested by the customer. In this frame, and under ESA ARTES funding, a Spanish consortium led by Hispasat is defining an operational GEO QKD mission that shall fly as hosted payload in 2025. The quantum communications payload proposed in this mission represents a step beyond the state of the art since it is the first implementation of a quantum key distribution channel from geostationary orbit. This new service will involve the implementation of a complete communications system not currently available that will require the development of new technological elements and the adaptation for their operation in space of technologies such as photon sources, telescopes for optical communications compatible with quantum state transmission or processors for the distillation of quantum keys, as well as a whole new ground segment to control and manage the new quantum key distribution service and its integration into a future European secure quantum communications network.

First, we establish the connection between the structures of entanglement using CNOT gates and the representations of directed multi-graphs, enabling a well-defined search space. The proposed encoding scheme of quantum entanglement as genotype vectors bridges the ansatz optimization and classical machine learning, allowing efficient search on any well-defined search space. Second, we instigate the entanglement level to reduce the cardinality of the search space to a feasible size for practical implementations. Finally, we mitigate the cost of evaluating the true loss function by using surrogate models via sequential model-based optimization. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach on simulated and bench-marking datasets, including Iris, Wine and Breast Cancer datasets, which empirically shows that found quantum embedding architecture by QES outperforms manual designs in term of the predictive performance.

Preparing for future hacking possibilities is deemed essential and crucial to combat data breaches and leaks. With the advent of quantum computing, a field capable of performing complex operations within a short time, breaking into the cryptographic system keys with sheer brute force is visibly possible. This paper aims to create a framework that runs post-quantum cryptographic algorithms shortlisted by NIST for Round 3 on the TLS protocol. The framework is built using Python with the help of LibOQS packages, programmed to work as an API, and invoked with the help of a web application. It allows cross-platform execution as it is contained in a Docker container. The established framework utilizes digital signature cryptography to verify the authenticity of a signed message and key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for secure communication between client and server. The algorithms can be integrated with various internet-based applications like IoT, blockchain, but the results are demonstrated using a web application for this research.

However, limited research has explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum circuits themselves resilient to noise.In this paper, we propose QuantumNAS, a comprehensive framework for noise-adaptive co-search of the variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural networks for machine learning and variational ansatzes for quantum simulation. However, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to decouple the circuit search from parameter training by introducing a novel SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of pre-defined parameterized gates (e.g., U3 and CU3) and trained by iteratively sampling and updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates in a fine-grained manner.Extensively evaluated with 12 quantum machine learning (QML) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) benchmarks on 14 quantum computers, QuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware search, human, random, and existing noise-adaptive qubit mapping baselines. For QML tasks, QuantumNAS is the first to demonstrate over 95% 2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class classification accuracy on real quantum computers. It also achieves the lowest eigenvalue for VQE tasks on H2, H2O, LiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD baselines. We also open-source the TorchQuantum library for fast training of parameterized quantum circuits to facilitate future research.

Existing encryption services based on Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Diffie-Hellman (DH), Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and so on are vulnerable to attacks by quantum computers. Although the gap between today's quantum computers and the threats they pose to current public-key cryptography is large, the telecommunications landscape should begin planning for the transition to the post-quantum era as early as possible. In this paper, we examine recent advances in Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms from the perspective of the networking and telecommunications industries. The efforts are categorized at three levels, namely communication, computation (consisting of design, implementation and Public Key System (PKS)), and network. Some of the existing challenges and future recommendations for securing communication networks in the post-quantum era are also listed at the end of the paper.

Especially in the upcoming quantum era, the existing cryptographic systems are vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. Motivated by these challenges, this article proposes a quantum-key-distribution (QKD)-based MG distributed control framework for cybersecurity enhancement. To defend the side-channel attacks and make the framework practical enough for industrial applications, measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) is introduced. The following contributions are made in this work. 1) A novel QKD-based quantum-secure control architecture is established to assure the data transmission security in MG distributed control. 2) MDI-QKD with asymmetric protocol is used to form a scalable QKD network for MG control. 3) A method for fast parameter optimization based on deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to adjust the parameters in QKD systems in real-time. Simulations are carried on a 13-bus MG to demonstrate the working principles of the proposed control scheme. The test results also prove the feasibility of the DNN-based parameter optimizer.

A vital element of C-ITS comprises vehicles, road side units, and traffic command centers, which produce a massive quantity of data comprising both mobility and service-related data. For the extraction of meaningful and related details out of the generated data, data science acts as an essential part of the upcoming C-ITS applications. At the same time, prediction of short-term traffic flow is highly essential to manage the traffic accurately. Due to the rapid increase in the amount of traffic data, deep learning (DL) models are widely employed, which uses a non-parametric approach for dealing with traffic flow forecasting. This paper focuses on the design of intelligent deep learning based short-term traffic flow prediction (IDL-STFLP) model for C-ITS that assists the people in various ways, namely optimization of signal timing by traffic signal controllers, travelers being able to adapt and alter their routes, and so on. The presented IDL-STFLP model operates on two main stages namely vehicle counting and traffic flow prediction. The IDL-STFLP model employs the Fully Convolutional Redundant Counting (FCRC) based vehicle count process. In addition, deep belief network (DBN) model is applied for the prediction of short-term traffic flow. To further improve the performance of the DBN in traffic flow prediction, it will be optimized by Quantum-behaved bat algorithm (QBA) which optimizes the tunable parameters of DBN. Experimental results based on benchmark dataset show that the presented method can count vehicles and predict traffic flow in real-time with a maximum performance under dissimilar environmental situations.

In particular, a family of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, consisting of classical and quantum elements, has been massively explored for the purpose of improving the performance of classical neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called quantum dilated convolutional neural networks (QDCNNs). Our method extends the concept of dilated convolution, which has been widely applied in modern deep learning algorithms, to the context of hybrid neural networks. The proposed QDCNNs are able to capture larger context during the quantum convolution process while reducing the computational cost. We perform empirical experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets for the task of image recognition and demonstrate that QDCNN models generally enjoy better performances in terms of both accuracy and computation efficiency compared to existing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs).

The most critical issues concern the physical layer, considering that the creation of entanglement over long distances is still problematic. Given the difficulty that usually arises from fiber optics due to exponential losses, the introduction of intermediate quantum repeaters (QRs) allows mitigating the problem. A quantum satellite network based on QRs on satellites deployed over low Earth orbit could make it possible to overcome the constraints of terrestrial optical networks. Hence, the recent technological developments in terms of quantum satellite communications motivated our investigation on an ad hoc quantum satellite backbone design based on the software defined networking paradigm with a control plane directly integrated into the constellation itself. Our aim is to outline some guidelines by comparing several options. Specifically, the focus is to analyze different architectural solutions making some considerations on their feasibility, possible benefits, and costs. Finally, we performed some simulations on the architectures we considered the most promising, concluding that the integration of the control plane in the constellation itself is the most appropriate solution.

Hence, the security of such QKD systems is compromised because of the secure key rate overestimation. Furthermore, we report a decoy-state BB84 QKD experiment considering polarization-dependent loss. Finally, we achieved rigorous finite-key security bound over up to 75 km fiber links by applying a recently proposed security proof. This study considers more realistic source flaws than most previous experiments; thus, it is crucial toward a secure QKD with imperfect practical devices.

(2022),2022,A Remote Security Computational Ghost Imaging Method Based on Quantum Key Distribution Technology,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3144297,"Computational ghost imaging (CGI) is a method of acquiring object information by measuring light field intensity, which would be used to achieve imaging in a complicated environment. The main issue to be addressed in CGI technology is how to achieve rapid and high-quality imaging while assuring the secure transmission of detection data in practical distant imaging applications. In order to address the mentioned issues, this paper proposes a remote secure CGI method based on quantum communication technology. Using the quantum key distribution (QKD) network, the CGI system can be reconstructed while solving the problem of information security transmission between the detector and the reconstructed computing device. By exploring the influence of different random measurement matrices on the quality of image reconstruction, it is found that the randomness of the numerical sequence constituting the matrix is positively correlated with the imaging quality. Based on this discovery, a new type of quantum cryptography measurement matrix is constructed using quantum cryptography with good randomness. In addition, through further orthogonalization and normalization of the matrix, the matrix has both good randomness and orthogonality, and high-quality imaging results can be obtained at a low sampling rate. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by simulation imaging experiments. Compared with the traditional GI system, the method proposed in this paper has higher transmission security and high-quality imaging under this premise, which provides a new idea for the practical development of CGI technology.

Given the recent advances in QKD networks, they have evolved from academic research to some preliminary applications. A QKD network consists of two or more QKD nodes interconnected by optical fiber or free space links. The secret keys are negotiated between any pair of QKD nodes, and then they can be delivered to multiple users in various areas for ensuring long-term protection and forward secrecy. We commence by introducing the QKD basics, followed by reviewing the development of QKD networks and their implementation in practice. Subsequently, we describe the general QKD network architecture, its elements, as well as its interfaces and protocols. Next, we provide an in-depth overview of the associated physical layer and network layer solutions, followed by the standardization efforts as well as the application scenarios associated with QKD networks.

However, the application of quantum computers in clouds would be realized from the recent breakthrough results of quantum computers. Existing authentication schemes based on conventional hardness assumptions will be confronted with quantum attackers in the near future. A lattice-based authentication scheme resolves this tension. Although, existing lattice-based authentication schemes employing identity-based signcryption (IBS), the security against misbehaved private key generators (mPKG) is not well-considered, which may cause privacy issues in some application scenarios since the mPKG can generate the secret key for any given identity. This paper proposes an IBS-based authentication scheme for cloud storage dubbed LAMA that thwarts adversaries who have quantum computing power. We integrate the IBS scheme with the lattice-based cryptography, which is the variant of existing IBS-based authentication schemes and is post-quantum secure. We integrate identity certifying authority (ICA) with private key generator (PKG) to ensure security against mPKG. Our comprehensive security proof demonstrates that LAMA is indistinguishable against chosen plaintext attacks and secure against mPKG. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of LAMA, which demonstrates the high efficiency of LAMA in terms of computation and communication overhead and proves that it can be easily deployed on low configured user devices.

Compared with classical networks, small-world quantum networks have some interesting properties. The topology of the network can be changed through entanglement exchange operations, and different network topologies will result in different percolation thresholds when performing entanglement percolation. A lower percolation threshold means that quantum networks require fewer minimum resources for communication. Since a shared singlet between two nodes can still be a limitation, concurrency percolation theory (ConPT) can be used to relax the condition. In this paper, we investigate how entanglement distribution is performed in small-world quantum networks to ensure that nodes in the network can communicate with each other by establishing communication links through entanglement swapping. Any node can perform entanglement swapping on only part of the connected edges, which can reduce the influence of each node in the network during entanglement swapping. In addition, the ConPT method is used to reduce the percolation threshold even further, thus obtaining a better network structure and reducing the resources required. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 by the authors.

Such technologies originate from different disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, Quantum Computing, and others.

Because quantum computers are becoming more capable, the creation of a new cryptographic standard that cannot be compromised by them is indispensable. There are several current proposals of quantum-resistant or post-quantum algorithms that are being considered for future standards. Given that the IoT is increasing in popularity, and given its resource-constrained nature, it is worth adapting those new standards to IoT devices. In this work, we study some post-quantum cryptosystems that could be suitable for IoT devices, adapting them to work with current cryptography and communication software, and conduct a performance measurement on them, obtaining guidelines for selecting the best for different applications in resource-constrained hardware.

(2022),2022,Post-quantum lightweight identity-based two-party authenticated key exchange protocol for Internet of Vehicles with probable security,Computer Communications,10.1016/j.comcom.2021.09.031,"With Internet of Things (IoT) growing rapidly, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become an essential part of smart cities and has attracted the full attention of both academic and business communities. Because of the public transmission channel, the security and privacy in IoV have paid serious attention. In IoV, it is crucial to generate a secret session key among the various vehicles and road-side units (RSUs) so that they can share the confidential information over the public Internet. Thus, an authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocol should be needed that can achieve the session key requirement in the IoV for secure communication. For this purpose, various AKA techniques has been designed using a number of different tools. Several existing AKA protocols either suffer from different attacks or inefficient for IoV environment due to its excessive communication and computational costs. Many such traditional schemes have used either DiffieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hellman (DH) or prime factorization type hard problems. These hard problems are vulnerable to the futuristic technologies like quantum computer. Besides, existing quantum resistance AKA protocols use lattice cryptography for its security. However, these protocols either incurs an overhead of certificate management or have excessive communication and computational costs. Hence, there is a need of quantum resistance AKA protocols which removes the certificate overhead and also efficient for the IoV. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based two-party authenticated key agreement (LB-ID-2PAKA) protocol using identity-based cryptography (IBC). The lattice hard problems could resist the quantum computers and IBC could remove the overhead of certificate management. The security strength of proposed LB-ID-2PAKA protocol is analyzed under the random oracle model to show its robustness against the present as well as future quantum attacks. In addition, the resiliency against different security attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, known-key security (K-KS), unknown key-share (UK-S) attack etc. are also included. Further, the performance analysis shows that the proposed LB-ID-2PAKA protocol outperforms the existing protocols and feasible for IoV applications.

(2022),2022,Artificial intelligence based clustering with routing protocol for internet of vehicles,"Computers, Materials and Continua",10.32604/cmc.2022.021059,"With recent advances made in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Cloud Computing (CC), the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) find it advantageous in terms of improvement in quality and interactivity of urban transportation service, mitigation of costs incurred, reduction in resource utilization, and improvement in traffic management capabilities. Many traffic-related problems in future smart cities can be sorted out with the incorporation of IoV in transportation. IoV communication enables the collection and distribution of real-time essential data regarding road network condition. In this scenario, energy-efficient and reliable intercommunication routes are essential among vehicular nodes in sustainable urban computing. With this motivation, the current research article presents a new Artificial Intelligence-based Energy Efficient Clustering with Routing (AI-EECR) Protocol for IoV in urban computing. The proposed AI-EECR protocol operates under three stages namely, network initialization, Cluster Head (CH) selection, and routing protocol. The presented AI-EECR protocol determines the CHs from vehicles with the help of Quantum Chemical Reaction Optimization (QCRO) algorithm. QCRO algorithm derives a fitness function with the help of vehicle speed, trust level, and energy level of the vehicle. In order to make appropriate routing decisions, a set of relay nodes was selected using Group Teaching Optimization Algorithm (GTOA). The performance of the presented AI-EECR model, in terms of energy efficiency, was validated against different aspects and a brief comparative analysis was conducted. The experimental outcomes established that AI-EECR model outperformed the existing methods under different measures. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 Tech Science Press.

It is anticipated that this computational advantage of QC will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable problems in several application domains such as drug design, data science, clean energy, finance, industrial chemical development, secure communications, and quantum chemistry. In recent years, tremendous progress in both quantum hardware development and quantum software/algorithm has brought QC much closer to reality. Indeed, the demonstration of quantum supremacy marks a significant milestone in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) eraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âthe next logical step being the quantum advantage whereby quantum computers solve a real-world problem much more efficiently than classical computing. As the quantum devices are expected to steadily scale up in the next few years, quantum decoherence and qubit interconnectivity are two of the major challenges to achieve quantum advantage in the NISQ era. QC is a highly topical and fast-moving field of research with significant ongoing progress in all facets. A systematic review of the existing literature on QC will be invaluable to understand the state-of-the-art of this emerging field and identify open challenges for the QC community to address in the coming years. This article presents a comprehensive review of QC literature and proposes taxonomy of QC. The proposed taxonomy is used to map various related studies to identify the research gaps. A detailed overview of quantum software tools and technologies, post-quantum cryptography, and quantum computer hardware development captures the current state-of-the-art in the respective areas. The article identifies and highlights various open challenges and promising future directions for research and innovation in QC.

They are proven rigorously that they reveal quantum advantages over conventional algorithms when their inputs are certain quantum data or some classical data mapped to quantum data. However, in a practical domain, data are classical in nature, and they are very big in dimension, size, and so on. Hence, there is a challenge to map (embed) classical data to quantum data, and even no quantum advantages of quantum algorithms are demonstrated over conventional ones when one processes the mapped classical data in a gate-based quantum computer. For the practical domain of earth observation (EO), due to the different sensors on remote-sensing platforms, we can map directly some types of EO data to quantum data. In particular, we have polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images characterized by polarized beams. A polarized state of the polarized beam and a quantum bit are the Doppelganger of a physical state. We map them to each other, and we name this direct mapping a natural embedding, otherwise an artificial embedding. Furthermore, we process our naturally embedded data in a gate-based quantum computer by using a quantum algorithm regardless of its quantum advantages over conventional techniques; namely, we use the QML network as a quantum algorithm to prove that we naturally embedded our data in input qubits of a gate-based quantum computer. Therefore, we employed and directly processed PolSAR images in a QML network. Furthermore, we designed and provided a QML network with an additional layer of a neural network, namely, a hybrid quantum-classical network, and demonstrate how to program (via optimization and backpropagation) this hybrid quantum-classical network when employing and processing PolSAR images. In this work, we used a gate-based quantum computer offered by an IBM Quantum and a classical simulator for a gate-based quantum computer. Our contribution is that we provided very specific EO data with a natural embedding feature, the Doppelganger of quantum bits, and processed them in a hybrid quantum-classical network. More importantly, in the future, these PolSAR data can be processed by future quantum algorithms and future quantum computing platforms to obtain (or demonstrate) some quantum advantages over conventional techniques for EO problems.

It is motivated by quantum computer's ability to perform computational tasks with efficiencies that are not possible with classical computers. Quantum computing technology has a lasting potential impact on society and broad implications on many aspects of our lives. Although quantum computing has several advantages, it threatens the security of current cryptographic techniques. It is expected that quantum computers will be able to solve the key distribution problem and break every single cryptography and authentication algorithm based on asymmetric cryptography. New emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, 5G, artificial intelligence and robotics all rely on cryptography for their secure operation. Therefore, the realisation of quantum computing will pose significant challenges to the current progress and future development of these technologies. In this paper, the quantum technology preliminaries are discussed. The possible impact of quantum technologies on emerging technologies is investigated.

To satisfy the needs of the mass deployment of ultra-high power required for classical optical networks integrating QKD, we implement the discrete variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) under up to 25 dBm launch power from classical channels over 75 km on an ultra-low-loss (ULL) fiber by combining a finite-key security analysis method with the noise model of classical signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest power launched by classical signals on the coexistence of DV-QKD and classical communication.

(2021),2021,On the Quantum Performance Evaluation of Two Distributed Quantum Architectures,Performance Evaluation Review,10.1145/3529113.3529123,"Distributed quantum applications impose requirements on the quality of the quantum states that they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations of quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in understanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum hardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and traditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world implementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades the quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two possible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum network. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in which the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The second corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions over two distinct devices. We model these architectures as continuous-time Markov chains and compare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled quantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that it takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an illustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on Nitrogen- Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for presentday device parameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications, and the other for networkheavy ones. We validate our analysis with the quantum network simulator NetSquid. Besides the detailed study of these architectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that connect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum quality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum technologies. This provides a valuable new tool for performance evaluation experts, and its applications extend beyond the two architectures studied in this work.

When sharing classical secrets (as opposed to quantum states), one can distinguish between protocols that leverage bipartite quantum key distribution (QKD) and those that exploit multipartite entanglement. The latter class are known to be vulnerable to so-called participant attacks and, while progress has been made recently, there is currently no analysis that quantifies their performance in the composable, finite-size regime, which has become the gold standard for QKD security. Given this - and the fact that distributing multipartite entanglement is typically challenging - one might well ask is there any virtue in pursuing multipartite entanglement-based schemes? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a class of secret-sharing protocols based on continuous-variable graph states. We establish security in a composable framework and identify a network topology, specifically a bottleneck network of lossy channels, and parameter regimes within the reach of present-day experiments for which a multipartite scheme outperforms the corresponding QKD-based method in the asymptotic and finite-size setting. Finally, we establish experimental parameters where the multipartite schemes outperform any possible QKD-based protocol. This is one of the first concrete compelling examples of multipartite entangled resources achieving a genuine advantage over point-to-point protocols for quantum communication and represents a rigorous, operational benchmark to assess the usefulness of such resources.

(2021),2021,A machine learning approach to Bayesian parameter estimation,npj Quantum Information,10.1038/s41534-021-00497-w,"Bayesian estimation is a powerful theoretical paradigm for the operation of the approach to parameter estimation. However, the Bayesian method for statistical inference generally suffers from demanding calibration requirements that have so far restricted its use to systems that can be explicitly modeled. In this theoretical study, we formulate parameter estimation as a classification task and use artificial neural networks to efficiently perform Bayesian estimation. We show that the networkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s posterior distribution is centered at the true (unknown) value of the parameter within an uncertainty given by the inverse Fisher information, representing the ultimate sensitivity limit for the given apparatus. When only a limited number of calibration measurements are available, our machine-learning-based procedure outperforms standard calibration methods. Our machine-learning-based procedure is model independent, and is thus well suited to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblack-box sensorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, which lack simple explicit fitting models. Thus, our work paves the way for Bayesian quantum sensors that can take advantage of complex nonclassical quantum states and/or adaptive protocols. These capabilities can significantly enhance the sensitivity of future devices.

Towards a global-scale quantum-secured network, satellite communications seem to be a promising candidate to successfully support the quantum communication infrastructure (QCI) by delivering quantum keys to optical ground terminals. In this research, we examined the feasibility of satellite-to-ground QKD under daylight and nighttime conditions using the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol. We evaluated its performance on a hypothetical constellation with 10 satellites in sun-synchronous Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that are assumed to communicate over a period of one year with three optical ground stations (OGSs) located in Greece. By taking into account the atmospheric effects of turbulence as well as the background solar radiance, we showed that positive normalized secure key rates (SKRs) up to 3.9 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢4 (bps/pulse) can be obtained, which implies that satellite-to-ground QKD can be feasible for various conditions, under realistic assumptions in an existing infrastructure.

One way to meet these growing demands is to hand over the learning of force fields and their parameters to machines in a systematic (semi)automatic manner. Doing so, we can take full advantage of exascale computing, the increasing availability of experimental data, and advances in quantum mechanical computations and the calculation of experimental observables from molecular ensembles. Here, we discuss and illustrate the challenges one faces in this endeavor and explore a way forward by adapting the Bayesian inference of ensembles (BioEn) method [Hummer and KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶finger, J.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â Chem.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â Phys.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â (2015)] for force field parameterization. In the Bayesian inference of force fields (BioFF) method developed here, the optimization problem is regularized by a simplified prior on the force field parameters and an entropic prior acting on the ensemble. The latter compensates for the unavoidable over simplifications in the parameter prior. We determine optimal force field parameters using an iterative predictorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“corrector approach, in which we run simulations, determine the reference ensemble using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), and update the force field according to the BioFF posterior. We illustrate this approach for a simple polymer model, using the distance between two labeled sites as the experimental observable. By systematically resolving force field issues, instead of just reweighting a structural ensemble, the BioFF corrections extend to observables not included in ensemble reweighting. We envision future force field optimization as a formalized, systematic, and (semi)automatic machine-learning effort that incorporates a wide range of data from experiment and high-level quantum chemical calculations, and takes advantage of exascale computing resources.

While satellite QKD cannot be effectively eavesdropped, we show it can be disrupted (or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“jammedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) with relatively simple and readily available equipment. We developed an atmospheric attenuation and satellite optical scattering model to estimate the rate of excess noise photons that can be injected into a satellite QKD channel by an off-axis laser, and calculated the effect this added noise has on the quantum bit error rate. We show that a ground-based laser on the order of 1 kW can significantly disrupt modern satellite QKD systems due to photons scattering off the satellite being detected by the QKD receiver on the ground. This class of laser can be purchased commercially, meaning such a method of disruption could be a serious threat to effectively securing high-value communications via satellite QKD in the future. We also discuss these results in relation to likely future developments in satellite-mediated QKD systems, and countermeasures that can be taken against this, and related methods, of disruption.

The task of multi-channel discrimination creates a scenario in which the discrimination of multiple quantum channels can be equated to the idea of pattern recognition, highly relevant to the tasks of quantum reading, illumination and more. Although the optimal quantum strategy for many scenarios is an entangled idler-assisted protocol, the extension to a multi-hypothesis setting invites the exploration of discrimination strategies based on unassisted, multipartite probe states. In this work, we expand the space of possible quantum-enhanced protocols by formulating general classes of unassisted multi-channel discrimination protocols which are not assisted by idler modes. Developing a general framework for idler-free protocols, we perform an explicit investigation in the bosonic setting, studying prominent Gaussian channel discrimination problems for real-world applications. Our findings uncover the existence of strongly quantum advantageous, idler-free protocols for the discrimination of bosonic loss and environmental noise. This circumvents the necessity for idler assistance to achieve quantum advantage in some of the most relevant discrimination settings, significantly loosening practical requirements for prominent quantum-sensing applications.

Our paper considers both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space) quantum communications. In the latter case, we show that high key rates are achievable for short-range optical wireless (LiFi) in secure quantum networks with both fixed and mobile devices.

Miniaturized, flexible, and cost-efficient resources will be key elements for ensuring the scalability of such networks as they progress towards large-scale deployed infrastructures. Here, we bring these elements together by combining an on-chip, telecom-wavelength, broadband entangled photon source with industry-grade flexible-grid wavelength division multiplexing techniques, to demonstrate reconfigurable entanglement distribution between up to 8 users in a resource-optimized quantum network topology. As a benchmark application we use quantum key distribution, and show low error and high secret key generation rates across several frequency channels, over both symmetric and asymmetric metropolitan-distance optical fibered links and including finite-size effects. By adapting the bandwidth allocation to specific network constraints, we also illustrate the flexible networking capability of our configuration. Together with the potential of our semiconductor source for distributing secret keys over a 60 nm bandwidth with commercial multiplexing technology, these results offer a promising route to the deployment of scalable quantum network architectures.

Probabilistic one-time programs harness these capabilities for quantum-assisted classical computations by encoding classical software in small quantum states resulting in computer programs that can be used only once. Such self-destructing one-time programs facilitate a variety of applications reaching from software distribution to one-time delegation of signature authority. Whereas previous experiments demonstrated the feasibility of such schemes, the practical applications were limited. Here we present an improved protocol for one-time programs that resolves major drawbacks of previous schemes, by employing entangled qubit pairs. This results in four orders of magnitude higher count rates and the ability to execute a program long after the quantum information exchange has taken place. We implement a one-time delegation of signature authority over an underground fiber link between university buildings in downtown Vienna, emphasizing the compatibility of our scheme with prepare-and-measure quantum internet networks.

It thus represents the ultimate form of cryptography, offering not only information-theoretic security against channel attacks, but also against attacks exploiting implementation loopholes. In recent years, much progress has been made towards realising the first DIQKD experiments, but current proposals are just out of reach of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s loophole-free Bell experiments. Here, we significantly narrow the gap between the theory and practice of DIQKD with a simple variant of the original protocol based on the celebrated Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality. By using two randomly chosen key generating bases instead of one, we show that our protocol significantly improves over the original DIQKD protocol, enabling positive keys in the high noise regime for the first time. We also compute the finite-key security of the protocol for general attacks, showing that approximately 108ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1010 measurement rounds are needed to achieve positive rates using state-of-the-art experimental parameters. Our proposed DIQKD protocol thus represents a highly promising path towards the first realisation of DIQKD in practice.

However, QKD requires the classical channel to be authenticated, the current method for which is pre-sharing symmetric keys. For a QKD network of n users, this method requires Cn2=n(nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢1)/2 pairs of symmetric keys to realize pairwise interconnection. In contrast, with the help of a mature public key infrastructure (PKI) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with quantum-resistant security, each user only needs to apply for one digital certificate from a certificate authority (CA) to achieve efficient and secure authentication for QKD. We need to assume only the short-term security of the PQC algorithm to achieve long-term security of the distributed keys. Here, we experimentally verified the feasibility, efficiency, and stability of the PQC algorithm in QKD authentication, and demonstrated the advantages when new users join the QKD network. Using the PQC public-key infrastructure, the nodes need to mutually trust only the CA to authenticate each other. QKD combined with PQC authentication will greatly promote and extend the application prospects of quantum-safe communication.

It's hardly surprising since our cognitive and social organizations typically discount many of the observations and patterns [1] that would alert us to such historical periods of upheaval [2]. The current suite of digital technologies has catalyzed a total upending of the previous distribution channels and management systems for the acquisition, distribution and assimilation of data, information and knowledge [3],[4],[5]. Today the ""digital generation""learns, interacts and transacts in ways that are foreign and suspicious to some of the current gatekeepers of traditional value storage implementations. [6] The global internet and cellular technologies have connected billions of people and trillions of objects into the most complex networks ever created. This fluid and non-deterministic system of systems has unleashed an unprecedented reservoir of creativity, opportunity, capability and risk. The topology of knowledge and connections has never been so asymmetric whereby a single organization or individual (sometimes anonymously) can quickly gain the control, attention and function of millions of machines and people for costs that are often deemed to be insignificant. [7] Traditional methods of security consistently fail because of the nature of this topology and asymmetry. This novel organization of knowledge combined with the power of ""action at a distance""requires a new paradigm to secure the future of open society and privacy. Traditional technology platforms for manufacturing, banking, healthcare, finance, social media etc., and their corresponding control mechanisms (digital signatures, passwords, virtual private networks) will potentially fall short in the face of pressure from new computer algorithms/technologies [8] and the global cultural shift that is now deemed to be irreversible (TikTok, WeChat, Facebook, Blockchain, Anonymous) [9]. Code can be exploited in exponential fashion and linear security countermeasures will continue to regularly fail. Undoubtedly, new network designs and technology paradigms will be needed to protect complex systems such as additive manufacturing machines, data and their associated supply chains. Quantum resistant algorithms [10] and novel encrypted and distributed data ledgers offer us hope to blunt this pernicious threat against a hyper-connected world.

These attacks require a reasonable amount of qubits, comparable to the number of qubits required to break RSA-2048. They are faster than other collision algorithms, and the attacks against PRINCE and Chaskey are the most efficient known to date. As Elephant has a key smaller than its state size, the algorithm is less efficient and its cost ends up very close to or above the cost of exhaustive search. We also propose an optimized quantum circuit for boolean linear algebra as well as complete reversible implementations of PRINCE, Chaskey, spongent and Keccak which are of independent interest for quantum cryptanalysis.

Since they are susceptible to be attacked, solutions must be explored to make them more trustworthy and, thus, increment the confidence of their users. It is common that trusted devices use secret keys to achieve confidentiality of data stored in non-volatile memory, data in transit, and to authenticate themselves to other parties. However, these keys can be compromised if an attacker takes control of the platform by exploiting some vulnerability. In this work, we propose to seal the secret keys to the platform and to a specific state, mainly associated with the memory content and determined in a development stage. The secret keys are encrypted with a Sealing Secret Key that is not stored in the device, but obfuscated with an SRAM PUF, making it more secure. When a secret key has to be sealed or unsealed, functions called seal() and unseal() are employed. They have atomic execution and are stored in a ROM memory. Their goal is to measure the state of the platform and recuperate the sealing secret key only if the measurement matches a valid one signed by the application developer. As quantum computers are emerging and future IoT devices must be resistant to attacks performed by them, we choose Dilithium and Saturnin as cryptographic primitives. Benchmarking results taken in an ESP32 microcontroller show the suitability of the proposal for an IoT device.

Herein, ANNs are implemented as propagators of the time-dependent SchrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶dinger equation to simulate the quantum dynamics of systems with time-dependent potentials. These ANN propagators are trained to map nonstationary wavepackets from a given time to a future time within the discrete variable representation. Each propagator is trained for a specified time step, and iterative application of the propagator enables the propagation of wavepackets over long time scales. Such ANN propagators are developed and applied to one- and two-dimensional proton transfer systems, which exhibit nuclear quantum effects such as hydrogen tunneling. These ANN propagators are trained for either a specific time-independent potential or general potentials that can be time-dependent.

To this end, we offer here a simple game-theoretic model of HFT as the famous two player game, PrisonerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dilemma. We explore the implementation of HFT as an instance of PrisonerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dilemma on the (quasi) quantum cloud using the Eisert, Wilkens, and Lewenstein quantum mediated communication protocol, and how this implementation can not only increase transaction speed but also improve the lot of the players in HFT. Using cooperative game-theoretic reasoning, we also note that in the near future when the internet is properly quantum, players will be able to achieve Pareto-optimality in HFT as an instance of reinforced machine learning.

(2021),2021,Post-quantum cryptography for automotive systems,Microprocessors and Microsystems,10.1016/j.micpro.2021.104379,"Automotive systems have become powerful computing platforms with an increasing demand for secure communication. The hyperconnectivity of the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment drastically increases the attack surface and the need for crypto-agility. In addition, the long lifecycle of automotive products demands that not only current but also future attacks are considered. Thus, empowering automotive devices with efficient, robust, and long-term security solutions is challenging. The foreseeable breakthrough of quantum computers and their threat to traditional cryptography requires that automotive devices are able to efficiently implement quantum secure cryptographic mechanisms, also known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). One of the most promising PQC approaches is lattice-based cryptography. Among the seven finalists of the NIST third round post-quantum standardization process, five algorithms (three KEM/encryption and two signature algorithms) belong to the category of lattice-based cryptography. While lattice-based cryptography has been previously integrated in general-purpose microcontrollers, their impact on automotive environments has been neglected. To this end, this work presents two contributions. As a first contribution, we provide a performance exploration of four lattice-based KEM/encryption algorithms implemented on the automotive microcontroller AURIX. The exploration includes the three finalists CRYSTALS-KYBER, NTRU, and Saber, together with ThreeBears. Despite ThreeBears was not selected as a PQC finalist, NIST recommended further investigations in this direction due to interesting security and performance characteristics of the algorithm. Our analysis has shown that all of these algorithms can be implemented on the AURIX microcontroller while achieving a competitive performance. As a second contribution, we explore the improvement of the security level of ThreeBears by extending its error correction capability.

The primary aim of grid computing is to combine the power of wide-ranging resources that are very diverse in nature and provide users with essential services to users in the future. Resources are complex and varying in a mobile grid system and the availability is limited for a period of time. With resource mobility in mind, classification is the most challenging and primitive challenge in the mobile grid environment. The previous paradigm outlined the Quantum based approach on Gravitational search Algorithm (QBGSA) for scheduling the task (job) on a mobile computing grid. In any case, it has problem with computational difficulty and execution time. To solve this problem, the proposed system designed an Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) clustering and Natural Exponential Inertia Weight with Artificial Bee Colony (NEIWABC) based scheduling approaches. In this proposed research work, grid server has all the information about mobile grid networks. Once it receiving the task request from user, it verifies the available resource providers. The nodes are clustered by using Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) clustering algorithm and Cluster Head (CH) selection is done using mobile capacity such as storage capacity, computational power. Then the task request is promoting to the selected CH in the cluster. Then the CH schedules the jobs to the appropriate mobiles to respond user. The task scheduling is performed by using Natural Exponential Inertia Weight with Artificial Bee Colony (NEIWABC) algorithm. The results of this experiment depicts that the proposed system attains good efficiency on comparison with previous system. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

208,1,C4,Madbouly et al. (2021),2021,Quantum game application to recovery problem in mobile database,Symmetry,10.3390/sym13111984,"Mobile Computing (MC) is a relatively new concept in the world of distributed computing that is rapidly gaining traction. Due to the dynamic nature of mobility and the limited bandwidth available on wireless networks, this new computing environment for mobile devices presents significant challenges in terms of fault-tolerant system development. As a consequence, traditional fault-tolerance techniques are inherently inapplicable to these systems. External circumstances often expose mobile systems to failures in communication or data storage. In this article, a quantum game theory-based recovery model is proposed in the case of a mobile hostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s failure. Several of the state-of-the-art recovery protocols are selected and analyzed in order to identify the most important variables influencing the recovery mechanism, such as the number of processes, the time needed to send messages, and the number of messages logged-in time. Quantum game theory is then adapted to select the optimal recovery method for the given environment variables using the proposed utility matrix of three players. Game theory is the study of mathematical models of situations in which intelligent rational decision-makers face conflicting interests (alternative recovery procedures). The purpose of this study is to present an adaptive algorithm based on quantum game theory for selecting the most efficient context-aware computing recovery procedure. The transition from a classical to a quantum domain is accomplished in the proposed model by treating strategies as a Hilbert space rather than a discrete set and then allowing for the existence of linear superpositions between classical strategies; this naturally increases the number of possible strategic choices available to each player from a numerable to a continuous set. Numerical data are provided to demonstrate feasibility. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 by the authors.

The area of Blockchain, Quantum computing, normal sharing of data over the network all uses the techniques of encrypting the data using some sort of keys. As the Machines and technology are becoming more and more powerful, legacy way of handling the communication needs a secure approach. This paper propose an idea of guessing the nonce or key, in such a way that it would evolve with the machines and technology. The Idea of Proposed adaptive algorithm works on challenges and using different challenges, the key is guess. There are three variations of this approach Direct, Separation and Pooling. The Messages are encrypted from the pooled of solved challenge keys and using the proposed techniques, nonce or key is selected mutually. Using Poission distribution, it is found that the identification of key becomes more robust as the level of communication increases. This Methodology allows the flexibility to change or make the challenge more complex depending upon their needs, which indeed increase the probability of guessing. This can also solve the problem of Denial of service(DOS) and spamming. In future of advance computations and development, this approach will be helpful in making the system secure.

Thus, a new area of quantum cryptography emerged, that lead to the development of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms and Quantum-safe Internet protocol Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). These systems, which are generally known as Quantum Cryptographic Systems, have many practical limitations that make them complex and expensive to be implemented or even experimented with, in a real-life scenario. Therefore, to develop new protocols and analyze the feasibility of the existing protocols in a cost-effective manner, we need efficient simulation frameworks.

Although the fundamental technology is not yet mature, research on quantum internet should be conducted. To implement quantum internet, an architecture that describes how quantum nodes are linked to form networks and how protocol functions are vertically composed need to be developed urgently. In this paper, we present a novel design of a cluster-based structure to describe how quantum nodes are interconnected, and how the structure can improve the performance of qubit transmission and reduce the network complexity. The idea of the quantum local area network (QLAN) is proposed as an essential component of the quantum internet. Besides, each quantum repeater links to neighboring repeaters to form a core network, and multiple QLANs are connected through the core network. The core network can be grouped into different hierarchical quantum repeater networks according to needed service requirements.

(2021),2021,High-speed batch processing of semidefinite programs with feedforward neural networks,New Journal of Physics,10.1088/1367-2630/ac2d72,"Semidefinite programming is an important optimization task, often used in time-sensitive applications. Though they are solvable in polynomial time, in practice they can be too slow to be used in online, i.e. real-time applications. Here we propose to solve feasibility semidefinite programs using artificial neural networks (NNs). Given the optimization constraints as an input, a NN outputs values for the optimization parameters such that the constraints are satisfied, both for the primal and the dual formulations of the task. We train the network without having to exactly solve the semidefinite program even once, thus avoiding the possibly time-consuming task of having to generate many training samples with conventional solvers. The NN method is only inconclusive if both the primal and dual models fail to provide feasible solutions. Otherwise we always obtain a certificate, which guarantees false positives to be excluded. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we examine the performance of the method on a hierarchy of quantum information tasks, the NavascuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s-Pironio-AcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n hierarchy applied to the Bell scenario. We demonstrate that the trained NN gives decent accuracy, while showing orders of magnitude increase in speed compared to a traditional solver, once trained. The network does not have to be retrained for similarly structured problems, giving the promise for being a fast solver for these types of problems. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 The Author(s).

(2021),2021,A dynamic service reconfiguration method for satelliteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrestrial integrated networks,Future Internet,10.3390/fi13100260,"SatelliteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are regarded as a promising solution to meeting the demands of global high-speed seamless network access in the future. Software-defined networking and network function virtualization (SDN/NFV) are two complementary technologies that can be used to ensure that the heterogeneous resources in STINs can be easily managed and deployed. Considering the dual mobility of satellites and ubiquitous users, along with the dynamic requirements of user requests and network resource states, it is challenging to maintain service continuity and high QoE performance in STINs. Thus, we investigate the service migration and reconfiguration scheme, which are of great significance to the guarantee of continuous service provisioning. Specifically, this paper proposes a dynamic service reconfiguration method that can support flexible service configurations on integrated networks, including LEO satellites and ground nodes. We first model the migration cost as an extra delay incurred by service migration and reconfiguration and then formulate the selection processes of the location and migration paths of virtual network functions (VNFs) as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem. Then, we propose a fuzzy logic and quantum genetic algorithm (FQGA) to obtain an approximate optimal solution that can accelerate the solving process efficiently with the benefits of the high-performance computing capacity of QGA. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and improved performance of the scheme proposed in this paper. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 by the authors.

Many factors influence the electricity load data such as air temperature, humidity and holidays, and they are taken as the explanatory variables in load forecasting cases traditionally. Search engine indices, a variable may be related to load data which has been never considered before in load forecasting, is discussed and utilized to increase the accuracy of power load prediction in this paper. Spearman's correlation coefficients and Granger test results verify the correlation between Google Trends (GT) and electricity load data. A methodology for processing GT time series with Hodrick-Prescott filter is proposed. To forecast electricity load with an adaptive network model in such a novel situation, we propose a long short-term memory neural network model based on quantum particle swarm algorithm. The performance of load forecast for Long Island region taking GT and weather data as input variables is compared with that taking only weather data as input variables, which shows that the introduction of GT improves short-term forecasting effectiveness significantly.

In order to compensate for the time drift caused by the Doppler effect and adapt to the unstable optical link in satellite-to-ground QKD, previous demonstrations generally adopted synchronization methods requiring additional hardware. In this paper, we present a novel synchronization method based on the detected quantum photons, thus simplifying additional hardware and reducing the complexity and cost. This method adopts target frequency scanning to realize fast frequency recovery, utilizes polynomial fitting to compensate for the Doppler effect, and takes use of the vacuum state in the decoy-state BB84 protocol to recover the time offset. This method can avoid the influence of synchronization light jitter, thus improving the synchronization precision and the secure keys as well. Successful satellite-to-ground QKD based on this new synchronization scheme has been conducted to demonstrate its feasibility and performance. The presented scheme provides an effective synchronization solution for quantum communication applications.

Compared with its classical version, quantum fingerprinting can realize exponential reduction in communication complexity. Recently, multiparty quantum fingerprinting is studied to determine whether the messages from many parties are all the same. However, the complete relationships among them, including which ones are the same, are more general for future applications. Here, we propose the relationship state to describe all possible relationships among messages. Based on this, we provide a general quantum fingerprinting network and then take the four-party quantum fingerprinting protocol as an example for detailed analysis. We take the full parameter optimization for the quantum fingerprinting protocol through asymmetric channel. The method of encoding more than one bit on each coherent state is used to further improve the performance of our protocol. Compared with other protocols, our protocol provides more relationships among different parties with only linear increase in communication complexity.

(2021),2021,Few-Mode-Fiber Technology Fine-tunes Losses in Quantum Communication Systems,Physical Review Applied,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.034018,"A natural choice for quantum communication is to use the relative phase between two paths of a single photon for information encoding. This method was nevertheless quickly identified as impractical over long distances, and thus a modification based on single-photon time bins has become widely adopted. It, however, introduces a fundamental loss, which increases with the dimension and limits its application over long distances. Here solve this long-standing hurdle by using a few-mode-fiber space-division-multiplexing platform working with orbital-angular-momentum modes. In our scheme, we maintain the practicability provided by the time-bin scheme, while the quantum states are transmitted through a few-mode fiber in a configuration that does not introduce postselection losses. We experimentally demonstrate our proposal by successfully transmitting phase-encoded single-photon states for quantum cryptography over 500 m of few-mode fiber, showing the feasibility of our scheme.

In this paper, we propose a measurement-device-independent quantum dialogue (MDI-QD) protocol using the polarizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“spatial-mode hyperentanglement. The protocol can eliminate the security loopholes related to measurement devices and the information leakage. Comparing with previous MDI-QD protocol, our MDI-QD protocol has higher channel capacity. Two communication parties can exchange 4 bits of messages per hyperentangled photon pair. Moreover, for promoting its practical application, we try to use the practical linear-optical partial hyperentangled Bell-state measurement in our MDI-QD protocol, with which the parties can exchange 3 bits of messages per hyperentangled photon pair. Our high-capacity MDI-QD protocol has application potential in future quantum communication field.

(2021),2021,Hybrid Trusted/Untrusted Relay-Based Quantum Key Distribution over Optical Backbone Networks,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,10.1109/JSAC.2021.3064662,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) has demonstrated a great potential to provide future-proofed security, especially for 5G and beyond communications. As the critical infrastructure for 5G and beyond communications, optical networks can offer a cost-effective solution to QKD deployment utilizing the existing fiber resources. In particular, measurement-device-independent QKD shows its ability to extend the secure distance with the aid of an untrusted relay. Compared to the trusted relay, the untrusted relay has obviously better security, since it does not rely on any assumption on measurement and even allows to be accessed by an eavesdropper. However, it cannot extend QKD to an arbitrary distance like the trusted relay, such that it is expected to be combined with the trusted relay for large-scale QKD deployment. In this work, we study the hybrid trusted/untrusted relay based QKD deployment over optical backbone networks and focus on cost optimization during the deployment phase. A new network architecture of hybrid trusted/untrusted relay based QKD over optical backbone networks is described, where the node structures of the trusted relay and untrusted relay are elaborated. The corresponding network, cost, and security models are formulated. To optimize the deployment cost, an integer linear programming model and a heuristic algorithm are designed. Numerical simulations verify that the cost-optimized design can significantly outperform the benchmark algorithm in terms of deployment cost and security level. Up to 25% cost saving can be achieved by deploying QKD with the hybrid trusted/untrusted relay scheme while keeping much higher security level relative to the conventional point-to-point QKD protocols that are only with the trusted relays.

CNN is extensively used in the area of image recognition and object detection for classification purposes. CNN is composed of several layers of filters to get feature maps of input data, yet foremost and crucial one is convolutional layer, hence the name Convolutional neural networks. However, the growth of quantum computing and quantum neural network in deep learning is limited. Three main obstacles that limit the growth of these are, first is due to the lack of real-time quantum computers to experiment with. Second is the improper training algorithms and at last, non-linearity nature of the neural networks. This paper introduces a novel approach to begin one's journey in quantum computing, along with solutions and developments. This work provides a detailed description of architectures, frameworks and algorithms used for implementing a QCNN model. The research was made regarding image recognition and object detection using QCNN and found that QCNN can increase the computational speeds with better performance metrics compared to classical computational methods. This paper also debates about applications of QCNN in computer vision, signal and image processing, Pharmaceuticals, Cryptography and various other fields.

As an example, the Madrid Quantum Network meets the requirements of this basic QI, proving to be a first step towards more complex architectures and functionalities.

In this protocol, we propose a faithful entanglement distribution protocol using quantum multiplexing of photon in a collective noise channel. By designing the encoding and decoding setup, our protocol can resist the collective noise. When the protocol is successful, the parties can obtain two pairs of maximally entangled states. When the protocol fails, the parties can still obtain one pair of maximally entangled state. Our protocol does not require the entanglement purification, so that it is more efficient.

As a matter of fact, the optical fiber technology is affected by extremely high losses; thus, the deployment of a quantum satellite network (QSN) composed of quantum satellite repeaters (QSRs) in low Earth orbit would make it possible to overcome these attenuation problems. For these reasons, we consider the design of an ad hoc quantum satellite backbone based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm with a modular two-tier Control Plane (CP). The first tier of the CP is embedded into a Master Control Station (MCS) on the ground, which coordinates the entire constellation and performs the management of the CP integrated into the constellation itself. This second tier is responsible for entanglement generation and management on the selected path. In addition to defining the SDN architecture in all its components, we present a possible protocol to generate entanglement on the end-to-end (E2E) path. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the developed protocol in terms of the latency required to establish entanglement between two ground stations connected via the quantum satellite backbone.

In this paper, we propose a quantum neural network, in which the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is used to optimize parameters. To analysze the system performance, it has been applied to function fitting and data classification and it is shown by classical simulation and experimentation that the proposed model is more efficient and powerful than ANN for a lot of experimental tasks.

Quantum computing finds plethora of applications in the 5G and Beyond networks. It can process data at an exponential rate, which can address numerous business and scientific challenges. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the field, starting from the most important applications of quantum computers and then diving into the future of cryptography. The major applications of quantum computing include unstructured search, quantum simulation, and optimization. It can also provide improvements in terms of speed and accuracy for some existing technologies, such as machine learning. These technologies have numerous applications in 5G and beyond networks. However, due to such abilities of quantum computing, it can also pose a serious risk to many existing security systems, especially the asymmetric key cryptography schemes. The risk of quantum computing has also influenced the mobile broadband standards to move from a symmetric key cryptography techniques to PKI-based trust model. We also discuss in detail various alternate cryptosystems based on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard even for a quantum computer to solve. In parallel, we discuss the developments in the field of quantum key distribution that makes use of quantum phenomenon to develop a quantum-resistant crypto systems. Such quantum-resistant systems have a great potential in provisioning secure 5G and beyond networks.

The purpose of this survey article is to carry out a systematic review in the area of quantum cryptography by covering various aspects of non-deterministic quantum key distribution protocols, quantum secure direct communication, semi-quantum key distribution, secure multiparty communication protocol, post-quantum cryptography and device-independent cryptography techniques. In addition, we also discussed various experimental work carried out in the area of quantum cryptography, various attacks and challenges relative to the paradigm shift from classical cryptography to quantum cryptography.

The novel geographic information web (GIW) application is proposed for dynamically predicting landslide risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The automated GIW system is coordinated between machine learning technologies, web technologies, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The new bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithm is presented to forecast landslides. The proposed algorithm consists of 3 major steps, the first of which is the construction of a landslide dataset by using Quantum GIS (QGIS). The second step is to generate the landslide-risk model based on machine learning approaches. Finally, the automated landslide-risk visualization illustrates the likelihood of landslide via Google Maps on the website. Four static factors are considered for landslide-risk prediction, namely, land cover, soil properties, elevation and slope, and a single dynamic factor i.e., precipitation. Data are collected to construct a geospatial landslide database which comprises three historical landslide locations-Phu Chifa at Thoeng District, Ban Pha Duea at Mae Salong Nai, and Mai Salong Nok in Mae Fa Luang District, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Data collection is achieved using QGIS software to interpolate contour, elevation, slope degree and land cover from the Google satellite images, aerial and site survey photographs while the physiographic and rock type are on-site surveyed by experts. The state-of-the-art machine learning models have been trained i.e., linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. Ablation studies have been conducted to determine the optimal parameters setting for each model. An enhancement method based on two-stage classifications has been presented to improve the landslide prediction of LSTM and Bi-LSTM models. The landslide-risk prediction performances of these models are subsequently evaluated using real-time dataset and it is shown that Bi-LSTM with Random Forest (Bi-LSTM-RF) yields the best prediction performance. Bi-LSTM-RF model has improved the landslide-risk predicting performance over LR, ANNs, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM in terms of the area under the receiver characteristic operator (AUC) scores by 0.42, 0.27, 0.46, and 0.47, respectively. Finally, an automated web GIS has been developed and it consists of software components including the trained models, rainfall API, Google API, and geodatabase.

The concept of quantum key pool (QKP) was introduced to offer an effective strategy for storing quantum keys. However, with the loss on its theoretical security due to storing these keys, balancing the storage of quantum keys and the security requirements of QKD-ONs poses a major challenge in their practical deployments. Hence, in this paper a concept of quasi-real-time key provisioning (QRT-KP) is introduced to address the tradeoff between quantum key storage and the degree of security. To satisfy the practical deployment of QRT-KP and the requirement of high-traffic flow, we propose a multi-path based QRT-KP (MP-QRT-KP) algorithm. Simulation results show that the MP-QRT-KP effectively enhances the performance of QKD-ONs in different scenarios, and it turns out that the algorithm performs better than single-path based QRT-KP (SP-QRT-KP) in terms of the success probability of key-allocation requests and key-resources utilization.

This popularity is attributed to elliptic curve cryptography's (ECC) known benefits including offering high-security levels for lesser key sizes in comparison to other known public key counterparts. With public key schemes being under the threat of becoming obsolete due to quantum computing and associated algorithms, we propose an enhancement to ECDH aiming at exponentially increasing the hardness of exhaustive search methods utilizing quantum computing powers. In order to reach a key agreement scheme that would withstand future and post-quantum processing powers, we introduce an enhancement that will be based on a distinct cryptographic property labeled 'Unpredictability', which offers algorithms the ability to use multiple key pairs (up to 256), in different combinations, all whilst maintaining substantially similar arithmetic operations.

Here we study the correlation of the structure of quantum information with physical noise models of various possible quantum memory implementations. Through numerical simulation of different noise models and approximate analytical formulas applied to a variety of interesting quantum states, we provide comparisons between quantum hardware with different structure, including both qubit- and qudit-based quantum memories.

The paper provides a thorough review of the state of the art HAP technologies and summarises the benefits that HAPs can bring to the QKD services. A detailed link budget analysis is presented in the paper to evaluate the feasibility of delivering QKD from stratospheric HAPs flying at 20 km altitude. The results show a generous link budget under most operating conditions which brings the possibility of using diverged beams, thereby simplifying the pointing, acquisition and tracking of the optical system on the HAPs and ground, potentially widening the range of future use cases where QKD could be a viable solution.

High-dimensional (HD) MDI-QKD in multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) can efficiently increase the key generation rate and has strong noise and error resistance. However, previous HD MDI-QKD protocols in multiple DOFs required complete hyperentangled Bell state analysis (HBSA), which cannot be realized under current experimental conditions and largely limits the practicality of the HD MDI-QKD. In this paper, we propose an HD MDI-QKD protocol in multiple DOFs which adopts a linear-optical HBSA. This adoption of the linear-optical HBSA makes our HD MDI-QKD feasible under current experimental technology. The key generation rate of our MDI-QKD protocol is about eight times of the original MDI-QKD protocol. Our HD MDI-QKD protocol may have potential applications in current and future quantum communication fields.

As the IoT network continues to grow, providing end-to-end security over IoT is becoming a paramount issue. To mitigate existing and future security risks within IoT, two important factors should be considered. First, some resource-constrained edge devices have an insufficient area to contain the security part. Second, the advent of quantum computers threatens the security of current public-key cryptography algorithms. In response to these challenges, lattice-based cryptography (LBC) has emerged as a promising technique for IoT security in the quantum era. The feasibility of LBC integration onto resource-constrained devices has been demonstrated in previous research. Multiplication is the main operation in Ring-BinLWE, a type of LBC. In this paper, a new multiplication method is proposed, which is called In-place modular Reduction and anti-circular Rotation Column-based Multiplication (In-place Rot-Col-Mul), and new Ring-BinLWE architecture is designed. In-place Rot-Col-Mul performs a column-based multiplication in which one rotation is executed per cycle. The design was implemented on TSMC-65nm technology and FPGA platforms. ASIC implementation results show a respective improvement in power and area over the state-of-the-art design by 48.42% and 57.8%, respectively.

In particular, the intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique - that allows treating irregular and inhomogeneous tumors while reducing the radiation toxicity on healthy organs - is based on the optimization problem of the beamlets intensities that shall result in a maximal delivery of the therapy dose to cancer while avoiding the organs at risk of being damaged by the radiation. The resulting optimization problem is expressed as a cost function to be optimized. Here, we map the cost function into an Ising-like Hamiltonian, describing a system of long-range interacting qubits. Finally, we solve the dose optimization problem by finding the ground-state of the Hamiltonian using a Tree Tensor Network algorithm. In particular, we present an anatomical scenario exemplifying a prostate cancer treatment. A similar approach can be applied to future hybrid classical-quantum algorithms, paving the way for the use of quantum technologies in future medical treatments.

At the core of this network lies the ability to generate and store entanglement at remote, interconnected quantum nodes2. Although various remote physical systems have been successfully entangled3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“12, none of these realizations encompassed all of the requirements for network operation, such as compatibility with telecommunication (telecom)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â wavelengths and multimode operation. Here we report the demonstration of heralded entanglement between two spatially separated quantum nodes, where the entanglement is stored in multimode solid-state quantum memories. At each node a praseodymium-doped crystal13,14 stores a photon of a correlated pair15, with the second photon at telecom wavelengths. Entanglement between quantum memories placed in different laboratories is heralded by the detection of a telecom photon at a rate up to 1.4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â kilohertz, and the entanglement is stored in the crystals for a pre-determined storage time up to 25Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â microseconds. We also show that the generated entanglement is robust against loss in the heralding path, and demonstrate temporally multiplexed operation, with 62Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â temporal modes. Our realization is extendable to entanglement over longer distances and provides a viable route towards field-deployed, multiplexed quantum repeaters based on solid-state resources.

Various quantum information protocols with diverse functionalities have been proposed and implemented. However, in general, the present quantum information system can only carry out a single information protocol or deal with a single communication task, which limits its practical application in the future. Therefore, it is essential to develop a multifunctional platform compatible with multiple different quantum information protocols. In this Letter, by utilizing an all-optical platform consisting of a gain-tunable parametric amplifier, a beam splitter, and an entanglement source, we experimentally realize the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol, which links the all-optical quantum teleportation protocol and the optimal 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢N coherent state cloning protocol. As a result, these three protocols, which have different physical essences and functionalities, are implemented in a single all-optical machine. In particular, we demonstrate that the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol can enhance the state transfer fidelity compared with all-optical quantum teleportation under the same strength of entanglement. Our all-optical quantum state transfer machine paves a way to implement the multifunctional quantum information system.

250,5,C3,Mousavi et al. (2021),2021,Fiber Bragg grating-electromagnetically induced transparent fast optical switch,OSA Continuum,10.1364/OSAC.415468,"Here, an all-optical switch is modeled in the form of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomena dealing with a three-level EIT silicon (Si) nanocrystalline medium. The EIT consists of two fields, namely a strong control and weak probe fields that interact with the medium. Fast-optical switching of the probe is achieved by applying a pulsed control field, which relies on both steady-state and transient density matrices. The effects of four significant parameters of interest, i.e., Rabi frequency of the control field, EIT nanocrystal density, FBG length, and spontaneous decay rate, have been extensively investigated to optimize the probe transmission. Subsequently, the time-dependent density matrix is solved to obtain the response time of the FBG-EIT switch. Eventually, FBG is modeled such that low index layers contain EIT material and the high index layers do not. The FBG-EIT switch satisfies the criteria of maximum transmission and minimum rise time to give out the optimal operational condition. Despite the optical switching is in OFF mode at Wc=0 THz demonstrating a high FBG reflectance, the reflectance suddenly vanishes at a certain ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â©scto satisfy the equivalence of low and high refractive indices (switching ON). Therefore, a fast-optical switch is envisaged operating as large as 100 GHz in theory. The future applications of the FBG- EIT include the fast Q-switching of fiber lasers, ultra-fast modulation, optical quantum communication, and high speed optical processing and computation.

It is believed that further progress requires the development of neuromorphic systems, in which hardware directly mimics the neuronal network structure of a human brain. Here, we propose theoretically and realize experimentally an optical network of nodes performing binary operations. The nonlinearity required for efficient computation is provided by semiconductor microcavities in the strong quantum light-matter coupling regime, which exhibit exciton-polariton interactions. We demonstrate the system performance against a pattern recognition task, obtaining accuracy on a par with state-of-the-art hardware implementations.

A crucial aspect in such approach is the stringent demand on communication among cores when qubits need to interact, which conditions the scalability potential of these architectures. In this work, we address the question of how the cost of the communication among cores impacts on the viability of the quantum multi-core approach. Methodologically, we consider a design space in which architectural variables (number of cores, number of qubits per core), application variables for several quantum benchmarks (number of qubits, number of gates, percentage of two-qubit gates) and inter-core communication latency are swept along with the definition of a figure of merit. This approach yields both a qualitative understanding of trends in the design space and companion dimensioning guidelines for the architecture, including optimal points, as well as quantitative answers to the question of beyond which communication performance levels the multi-core architecture pays off. Our results allow to determine the thresholds for inter-core communication latency in order for multi-core architectures to outperform single-core quantum processors.

253,4,C1,Zhong et al. (2021),2021,Continuous-variable quantum key distribution coexisting with classical signals on few-mode fiber,Optics Express,10.1364/OE.420583,"Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) holds an advantage of well compatibility with classical coherent optical communications. However, there exists a performance trade-off between CVQKD and classical communication on single-mode fiber (SMF) because of the spontaneous Raman scattering. Space-division multiplexing (SDM) technique may provide a feasible way to mitigate this performance trade-off in short-distance communication while CVQKD coexisting with classical signals on few-mode fiber (FMF). Here, we examine the feasibility of CVQKD coexisting with classical signals on FMF and analyze the noise impact in weak coupling regime. We find that the inter-mode crosstalk generated from the mode coupling and re-coupling between modes and the group delay spread originated from the differential group delay (DGD) contribute the main noise sources. DGD may become one of the main limits for FMF-based CVQKD towards high-speed system. In addition, a well channel wavelength management is needed to suppress the inter-mode four-wave-mixing for achieving the positive secret key rates. The numerical simulations identify the key parameters for CVQKD system, enabling a helpful insight for realizing security analysis of the Gaussian modulated coherent state protocol. It shows that CVQKD coexisting with high power classical signals on FMF is feasible to implement with standard telecommunication components and able to operate at higher secret key rates. The results may provide a potential guideline for the practical high-rate CVQKD integrating with the FMF-based configuration.

255,4,C7,Krishnan & (2021),2021,Lockable signatures for blockchains: Scriptless scripts for all signatures,Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,10.1109/SP40001.2021.00065,"Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) have given a huge boost to the scalability of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies: Beyond improving the transaction rate, PCNs enabled cheap cross-currency payments and atomic swaps. However, current PCNs proposals either heavily rely on special scripting features of the underlying blockchain (e.g. Hash Time Lock Contracts) or are tailored to a handful of digital signature schemes, such as Schnorr or ECDSA signatures. This leaves us in an unsatisfactory situation where many currencies that are being actively developed and use different signature schemes cannot enjoy the benefits of a PCN.In this work, we investigate whether we can construct PCNs assuming the minimal ability of a blockchain to verify a digital signature, for any signature scheme. In answering this question in the affirmative, we introduce the notion of lockable signatures, which constitutes the cornerstone of our PCN protocols. Our approach is generic and the PCN protocol is compatible with any digital signature scheme, thus inheriting all favorable properties of the underlying scheme that are not offered by Schnorr/ECDSA (e.g. aggregatable signatures or post-quantum security).While the usage of generic cryptographic machinery makes our generic protocol impractical, we view it as an important feasibility result as it may serve as the basis for constructing optimized protocols for specific signature schemes. To substantiate this claim, we design a highly efficient PCN protocol for the special case of Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. BLS signatures enjoy many unique features that make it a viable candidate for a blockchain, e.g. short, unique, and aggregatable signatures. Yet, prior to our work, no PCN was known to be compatible with it (without requiring an advanced scripting language). The cost of our PCN is dominated by a handful of calls to the BLS algorithms. Our concrete evaluation of these basic operations shows that users with commodity hardware can process payments with minimal overhead.

Among these terahertz communication technologies, terahertz direct modulation technology is a key means to achieve low system complexity and power consumption.

Photon transmission loss is one of the main obstacles of quantum communication, which can reduce the communication efficiency and even threaten the security. In the paper, we propose a feasible noiseless linear amplification (NLA) protocol for protecting the single-photon qudit and two-photon hyperentanglement encoded in polarization and double-longitudinal momentum degrees of freedom (DOFs). The NLA protocol is in linear optics, and especially, it adopts practical imperfect single photon sources to generate auxiliary photons. As a result, it can be realized under current experimental condition. By performing the NLA protocol, we can increase the fidelity of target qudit and hyperentanglement and preserve their encoding features in all DOFs. This NLA protocol has application potential in current and future high-capacity quantum communication field.

(2021),2021,Group Transference Techniques for the Estimation of the Decoherence Times and Capacities of Quantum Markov Semigroups,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,10.1109/TIT.2021.3065452,"Capacities of quantum channels and decoherence times both quantify the extent to which quantum information can withstand degradation by interactions with its environment. However, calculating capacities directly is known to be intractable in general. Much recent work has focused on upper bounding certain capacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from operator theory. In the meantime, there has also been substantial recent progress on estimating decoherence times with techniques from analysis and geometry, even though many hard questions remain open. In this article, we introduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called transferred channels, which are built through representation theory from a classical Markov kernel defined on a compact group. In particular, we study two subclasses of such kernels: HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rmander systems on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on finite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing channel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on d qubits. Some of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels that randomly swap subsystems. We then extend tools developed in earlier work by Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of the classical Markov kernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different non-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article is the application of this transference principle to the estimation of decoherence time, of private and quantum capacities, of entanglement-assisted classical capacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking times, defined as the first time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking. Moreover, our estimates hold for non-ergodic channels such as the collective decoherence channels, an important scenario that has been overlooked so far because of a lack of techniques.

However, the application of quantum computers in clouds would be realized from the recent breakthrough results of quantum computers. In the near future, existing conventional hardness-based authentication schemes will be confronted with quantum attackers. Lattice-based authentication scheme resolves this tension. Albeit, existing lattice-based schemes, users and cloud servers are always worried about the communication privacy against misbehaved private key generator referred to as mPKG since PKG potentially has the power to generate the secret key for any given identity. In this paper, we proposed a secure authentication scheme for cloud storage that thwarts the misbehaved PKG. We integrate the identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme with the lattice-based signature, which is the variant of existing IBE-based authentication schemes and post-quantum secure. Additionally, we integrate identity certifying authority (ICA) with PKG to ensure security against misbehaved PKG. Our comprehensive security proof demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides stronger security guarantees against misbehaved PKG and ICA.

The proposed scheme is also very friendly to parallel implementation, enabling efficient deployment of edge nodes authentication at high throughput.

On the other hand, the same innovation has led to various negative aspects like theft, cybercrime and plenty of unseen malfunctions. In this digital world, it has become mandatory that everyone in some way or other communicate sensitive information via Internet. Though many security mechanisms are available, there is always a threat in its implementation. The development of fast performing quantum computers even though a boon to robotics and computing systems it has become a nightmare in the field of cryptography. The mathematical toughness in the modern cryptosystems has become very simple to solve by using quantum computers. This made NIST to solicit proposals for post-quantum cryptography, which should include standards to be used as quantum resistant counterparts to the existing standards. In this paper, a competent Intelligent Key Cryptography (IKC) system is proposed, highlighting that, there is no need to exchange the keys either by public or private means among the users but it resides in the transmitting message itself. IKC is a tamil based random key generator, which is a promising challenge to change the current key based crypto system. Furthermore, a performance analysis could be done as a future task.

(2021),2021,A Novel Approach for Service Function Chain Embedding in Cloud Datacenter Networks,IEEE Communications Letters,10.1109/LCOMM.2020.3043845,"Network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) have recently introduced together, which show great potential in openness, innovation, flexibility and scalability of the networks. Embedding SDN/NFV-enabled service function chain (SFC) has been considered as an efficient way to achieve the end-to-end communication. Considering the multiple users' delay diversities oriented to future networks, from the perspective of network operators, determining the placement of virtual network functions (VNFs) and routing the service paths is a challenging problem. However, the traditional solutions (e.g., exact, heuristic, meta-heuristic, game, etc.) based on the SFC dynamic embedding problem (SFC-DMP) follow the strong assumptions as usual, which might limit their applications in dynamic and complex network scenarios.

Modern networking is presently undergoing through a quantum leap. To cope up with ambitious demands and user expectations, it is becoming more complex both structurally and functionally. Software Defined Networking (SDN) happens to be an instance of such advancements. It has significantly leveraged the network programmability, abstraction, and automation. Eventually, with acceptance form all major network infrastructure such as 5G and Cloud, SDN is becoming the standard of future networking. Likewise, Machine Learning (ML) has become the trendiest skill-in-demand recently. With its superiority of analyzing data, makes it applicable for almost every possible domain. The attempt to applying the power of ML in networking has not been too long, it allows the network to be more intelligent and capable enough to take optimal decisions to address some of its native problems. This gives rise to Self- Organized Networking (SON). In this article, Routing using Deep Neural Network (DNN) on top of SDN is addressed. We proposed a Self-organized Knowledge Defined Network (SO-KDN) architecture and an intelligent routing algorithm, that reactively finds the most reliable route, i.e., a route having least probability of fluctuation. This reduces network overhead due to re-routing and optimizes traffic congestion. Experimental data show a mean 90% accurate forecast in reliability prediction.

However, a linear rate-distance limitation severely constrains the secure key rate and transmission distance of QSS. Here, we present a practical QSS protocol among three participants based on the differential phase shift scheme and twin field ideas for the solution of high-efficiency multiparty communication task. In contrast to a formerly proposed differential phase shift QSS protocol, our protocol can break the linear rate-distance bound, theoretically improving the secret key rate by three orders of magnitude in a 300-km-long fiber. Furthermore, the new protocol is secure against Trojan horse attacks that cannot be resisted by previous differential phase shift QSS.

Here, we present an experimental investigation of QKD and decoy-state QKD based on the BB84 protocol. The experiment was carried out in a 10 m water tank. The attenuation coefficient of tap water is 0.08/m, which is close to Jerlov Type II seawater. We measured the probability-of-detection matrix of polarization states, and the average fidelity of the four polarization states is up to 98.39%. For the 10 m underwater QKD experiment, 20 MHz optical pulses are generated by modulating the laser diode (LD) and attenuated to an average of 0.1 photons per pulse. The security key rate can reach 563.41 kbits/s and the quantum bit error rate (QBER) is 0.36%. Two decoy states (one of which is the vacuum state) was used in the 10 m underwater decoy-state QKD experiment, and the average QBER of signal state is 0.95%, the security key rate reaches 711.29 kbits/s. According to the parameters of the decoy-state experiment, the maximum secure transmission distance of the underwater decoy-state QKD is predicted to be 19.2 m, while it can be increased to 237.1 m in Jerlov Type I seawater with a lower dark count single photon detector (SPD).

269,3,C1,Brandmeier et al. (2021),2021,Future Development of Quantum Computing and Its Relevance to NATO,Connections,10.11610/Connections.20.2.08,"The first quantum computers are becoming a reality, and scientists working in various areas look forward to taking advantage of their enormous computational potential. At the same time, the high performance of quantum computers imposes serious risks for cybersecurity. We can expect an arms race between rival parties: a defensive side trying to ensure the privacy and dependability of stored and transmitted information and their adversaries. With this article, the authors aim to provide an overview of the status of quantum computer development, project the next steps, and investigate the impact future quantum systems may have on cybersecurity and military operations. We first discuss the basic aspects that differentiate quantum computing from classical computing and find that analogies between both domains are quite limited. The world of quantum computers is remarkably diverse already, and we elaborate that quantum simulators and universal quantum computers have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œqubitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â in com-mon but still work in fundamentally different ways. Since security experts focus on upcoming trends in quantum computing, we take a look at the latest technologies and at the race for first reaching ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œquantum supremacy.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the specific risks future quantum computers represent for established cryptosystems and conclude that asymmetric algorithms like the RSA protocol are particularly vulnerable. The dangers of quantum computing for cryptography are obvious, as is the high relevance of the safety of stored and transmitted data to the defense sector. However, we examine the capability spectrum of quantum technologies and discover that breaking asymmetric encryption algorithms is just one facet, and other features like GroverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quantum algorithm may revolutionize the logistics of the armed forces. Satellite Quantum Key Distribution is another promising concept that may change the communication between military units. To NATO, quantum computing is a double-edged sword: the alliance needs to use the developments to benefit from the potential and be ready to counter the cyber threats. We derive ideas of what NATO should do in order to prepare for the quantum era. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021, Partnership for Peace Consortium of Defense Academies and Security Studies Institutes.

Due to the limitation of physical resources and experimental conditions, the effectiveness of different communication protocols cannot be accurately analyzed.

On the Eclipse IDE Developers platform, the simulation program of the quantum communication protocol was written using Java language, the simulation process under the ideal environment and the eavesdropping environment was analyzed with emphasis. The simulation results show that the key distribution efficiency of BB84 is about 50% without eavesdroppers, which is much higher than 25% of B92, and the key distribution efficiency under eavesdropping conditions is about 25% and 18%. The experimental results are consistent with theoretical expectations, verifying the correctness of the protocol simulation, and also proving the feasibility of using computers for quantum communication protocol simulation.

We carry on the optimization and simulation to Turbo and increases its error correction efficiency by 15%.

(2021),2021,Quantum Semantic Learning by Reverse Annealing of an Adiabatic Quantum Computer,Advanced Quantum Technologies,10.1002/qute.202000133,"Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) constitute a class of neural networks for unsupervised learning with applications ranging from pattern classification to quantum state reconstruction. Despite the potential representative power, the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited since their training process proves to be hard. The advent of commercial adiabatic quantum computers (AQCs) raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices can increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. Here, the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs is demonstrated, thanks to an embedding that associates the nodes of the neural networks to virtual qubits. A semantic quantum search is implemented thanks to a reverse annealing schedule. Such an approach exploits more information from the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling algorithm. The semantic training is shown to quickly raise the sampling probability of a subset of the set of the configurations. Even without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule, the RBM semantically trained achieves good scores on reconstruction tasks. The development of such techniques paves the way toward the establishment of a quantum advantage of adiabatic quantum computers, especially given the foreseen improvement of suchÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â hardware.

Currently, quantum information has the advantage of being safer and faster than conventional digital computers. Thus, a lot of research is being done. The amount of big data that one needs to deal with is expected to grow exponentially. It is also a new business model that can change the landscape of the existing computing. Just as the IT sector has faced many challenges in the past, we need to be prepared for change brought about by Quantum. We would like to look at studies on quantum communication, quantum sensing, and quantum computing based on quantum information and see the technology levels of each country and company. Based on this, we present the vision and challenge for quantum information in the future. Our work is significant since the time for first-time study challengers is reduced by discussing the fundamentals of quantum information and summarizing the current situation.

Besides the unconditional security, people also seek for high key generation rate, but MDI-QKD has relatively low key generation rate. In this paper, we provide an efficient approach to increase the key generation rate of MDI-QKD by adopting multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) of single photons to generate keys. Compared with other high-dimension MDI-QKD protocols encoding in one DOF, our protocol is more flexible, for our protocol generating keys in independent subsystems and the detection failure or error in a DOF not affecting the information encoding in other DOFs. Based on above features, our MDI-QKD protocol may have potential application in future quantum communication field.

Development of wireless transceivers of higher bandwidth, low energy consumption, and small footprint becomes challenging with radio frequency (RF) electronic technologies. Photonics-assisted technologies show many advantages in generating signals of ultrabroad bandwidth at high carrier frequencies in the millimeter-wave, terahertz, and IR bands. Among these frequency options, the mid-IR band has recently attracted great interest for future wireless communication due to its intrinsic merits of low propagation loss and high tolerance of atmospheric perturbations. A promising source for mid-IR free-space communications is the semiconductor quantum cascade laser (QCL), which can be directly modulated at a high speed and facilitates monolithic integration for compact transceivers. Herein, the research and development of QCL-based free-space communications are reviewed and a recent experimental study of multi-gigabit transmission with a directly modulated mid-IR QCL and a commercial off-the-shelf IR photodetector is reported on. Up to 4 Gb sÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢1 transmission of two advanced modulation formats, namely, four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) and discrete multitone (DMT) modulation, is demonstrated.

This serves as both a summary of the landscape and provides a basis to construct a trajectory of the future in the field. The paper concludes that many of these areas of study suffer similar drawbacks when being realized and that some require more theoretical advancement.

The processing of load forecast data and the selection of forecasting methods are particularly important. In order to get accurate and effective prediction for power system load, this article proposes a hybrid multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm for short-term load forecast of power system based on diagonal recursive neural network. Firstly, a multi-objective mathematical model for short-term load forecast is proposed. Secondly, the discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to select the characteristics of load data and screen out the appropriate data. Finally, the hybrid multi-objective QPSO algorithm is used to train diagonal recursive neural network.

ShorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s algorithm proved that a quantum computer could traverse key of factoring problems in polynomial time. Because the time-complexity of the exhaustive key search for quantum computing has not reliably exceeded the reasonable expiry of crypto key validity, it is believed that current cryptography systems built on top of computational security are not quantum-safe. Quantum key distribution fundamentally solves the problem of eavesdropping; nevertheless, it requires quantum preparatory work and quantum-network infrastructure, and these remain unrealistic with classical computers. In transitioning to a mature quantum world, developing a quantum-resistant mechanism becomes a stringent problem. In this research, we innovatively tackled this challenge using a non-computational difficulty scheme with zero-knowledge proof in order to achieve repellency against quantum computing cryptanalysis attacks for universal classical clients.

Quantum computing may offer speed-up for HEP physics analyses at HL-LHC, and can be a new computational paradigm for big data analyses in High Energy Physics. We have successfully employed three methods (1) Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) method, (2) Quantum Support Vector Machine Kernel (QSVM-kernel) method and (3) Quantum Neural Network (QNN) method for two LHC flagship analyses: ttH (Higgs production in association with two top quarks) and H->mumu (Higgs decay to two muons, the second generation fermions). We shall address the progressive improvements in performance from method (1) to method (3). We will present our experiences and results of a study on LHC High Energy Physics data analyses with IBM Quantum Simulator and Quantum Hardware (using IBM Qiskit framework), Google Quantum Simulator (using Google Cirq framework), and Amazon Quantum Simulator (using Amazon Braket cloud service). The work is in the context of a Qubit platform (a gate-model quantum computer). Taking into account the present limitation of hardware access, different quantum machine learning methods are studied on simulators and the results are compared with classical machine learning methods (BDT, classical Support Vector Machine and classical Neural Network). Furthermore, we do apply quantum machine learning on IBM quantum hardware to compare performance between quantum simulator and quantum hardware. The work is performed by an international and interdisciplinary collaboration with the Department of Physics and Department of Computer Sciences of University of Wisconsin, CERN Quantum Technology Initiative, IBM Research Zurich, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Fermilab Quantum Institute, BNL Computational Science Initiative, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Quantum Computing and AI Research of Amazon Web Services. This work pioneers a close collaboration of academic institutions with industrial corporations in the High Energy Physics analyses effort. Though the size of event samples in future HL-LHC physics and the limited number of qubits pose some challenges to the Quantum Machine learning studies for High Energy Physics, more advanced quantum computers with larger number of qubits, reduced noise and improved running time (as envisioned by IBM and Google) may outperform classical machine learning in both classification power and in speed. Although the era of efficient quantum computing may still be years away, we have made promising progress and obtained preliminary results in applying quantum machine learning to High Energy Physics.

There-fore, it is of great importance to detect electricity theft from both an economic and social perspective. With the help of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids, now it is possible to detect theft activities through analyzing the recorded electricity consuming data using advanced techniques, such as machine learning. However, training a learning model, especially for the ones with a huge amount of parameters, is always resource-consuming, and users could encounter performance bottlenecks due to hardware limitations. To improve the problem, using quantum computing for machine learning tasks has shown to be an effective approach to speed up the learning process. However, the relevant techniques have not been studied in the domain of energy yet. As a pioneering exploration, in this work, we are trying to leverage a quantum classification algorithm to classify the electricity dataset and on that basis to perform a case study on theft activity detection. Specifically, we have given the details of our design in the study, and our experimental results show that the prediction accuracy can be significantly improved with increasing training epochs, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum machine learning for energy data analysis.

DEVELOPING EUROPEAN CAPABILITIES: THE PUSH FOR NEXT GENERATION OPTICAL TELECOMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",,"In the recent years, the global SatCom market showed as steady decline in customer demand. The multibillion EUR market is one of the cornerstones of the traditional commercial space market and is predominantly impacted by the steady rise of broadband internet services. Optical communication technologies have the capacity to revolutionize SatCom. Optical communication in space in the Tbps range seem technologically feasible in the coming years. Such data rates meet or even exceed current trends derived from system architectures for 5G, IoT concepts or manned lunar and deep space missions. The European Space Agency (ESA) is engaged in stimulating the European space industry to address this matter by various initiatives to develop the next generation of optical telecommunication technologies. ESA has already established first installations in orbit and demonstrated the feasibility of optical telecommunication technologies, and positioned European industry at the forefront of a global race. Various activities are being pursued in this field by the global space community, from precision ranging to optical data transport and quantum communication technologies.

While symmetric algorithms can adapt to those challenges, no prevalent key exchange method can protect against quantum computer based attacks. There already exist several new, quantum-resistant approaches. Yet, all of them either lack in confidence regarding their security or require large data to be transmitted. Due to the lack of confidence in these algorithms, researchers tend towards hybrid key exchange methods which combine at least two different algorithms. As long as one of them prevails, the shared secret remains secure. Yet, these hybrid key exchanges together with algorithms which transmit large payloads require significant changes to the design of security protocols. IKEv2 is willing to introduce radical changes in order to support as many different algorithms as possible. This was expected to impact the protocol's operational feasibility, but remained to be tested due to the lack of a working reference implementation of the newly proposed internet drafts. To address this issue, we implemented these drafts using a modified version of the OpenIKED as basis that already comprised the first steps towards the concept's integration. During the implementation we found that several design choices severely hinder a clean and maintainable structure. With the resulting implementation, we tested the adjusted protocol under real-world conditions. The results show that the result generally works but struggles to cope with slow, lossy networks. Based on these insights, we drafted an improved protocol design which also supports the full range of quantum-resistant key exchange methods. In contrast to the current drafts, it promises a cheaper and more maintainable implementation.

By leveraging the power of quantum computing, deep neural networks can potentially overcome computational power limitations in classic machine learning. However, when multiple quantum machines wish to train a global model using the local data on each machine, it may be very difficult to copy the data into one machine and train the model. Therefore, a collaborative quantum neural network framework is necessary. In this article, we borrow the core idea of federated learning to propose QuantumFed, a quantum federated learning framework to have multiple quantum nodes with local quantum data train a mode together.

DTLS is the UDP counterpart of TLS (Transport Layer Security) and proposed to secure control messages in 5G networks. We offer a novel and efficient approach for providing secure source authentication and message integrity for DTLS that removes the need for a computationally expensive key exchange for message integrity by using PQ TESLA (Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication) that relies on delayed key release mechanism to provide integrity and use a PQ hash-based signature for providing PQ source authentication.

There are quantum neurons that can carry an exponential amount of information to a linear number of quantum information units (qubits) using the quantum property of superposition. In this paper, we compare the performance of three of these quantum neuron models applied to the diabetes classification problem. We also propose the use of different data preprocessing strategies. Quantum neurons were simulated using the IBM Qiskit tool. We compare the preprocessing approaches applied to two toy problems (1) simulating the XOR operator and (2) solving a generic nonlinear problem. The results of the experiments shows that a single quantum neuron is capable of achieving an accuracy rate of 100% in the XOR problem and an accuracy rate of 100% in a non-linear dataset, demonstrating that the quantum neurons with real weights are capable of modeling non-linearly separable problems. In the problem of diagnosing diabetes, quantum neurons achieved an accuracy rate of 76% and AUC-ROC of 88%, while its classic version, the perceptron, reached only 63% accuracy and the artificial neural network reached 80% AUC-ROC. These results indicate that a single quantum neuron performs better than its classical version and even the artificial neural network for AUC-ROC, demonstrating potential for use in healthcare applications in the near future.

(2021),2021,The Future of mm-wave Wireless Communication Systems for Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles in the Era of Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing,"2021 IEEE MetroCon, MetroCon 2021",10.1109/MetroCon54219.2021.9666048,"As wireless networks are getting increasingly complex, there is a strong need to develop novel approaches and capabilities for high throughput communication and processing of wireless data. This need is more pressing as unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) are applied in new areas and innovations such as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) swarms are developed. Millimeter-wave helps to meet the throughput demand as it provides the higher bandwidth that is needed for 5G wireless communication and beyond. But these higher frequencies also come with their own challenges, such as low signal penetration depth. The main challenge in modern wireless networks is to be able to accurately predict the dynamically changing radio environment. With the introduction of narrow beams in the mm-wave frequency, tracking of the beams is a great challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) could be employed to resolve this problem of beam tracking. In this talk, the challenges in mm-wave wireless networks for vehicle-to-vehicle communication will be highlighted and the ideas involving recent developments in phased-array antenna, beam-steering, beam-alignment, and tracking will be discussed. We shall then critically evaluate the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) within the network architecture to provide the required capability for tasks such as beam-control, data-feed processing, resource, and interference management. The next-generation wireless networks need to be self-predictive and proactive to handle futuristic applications like holographic communication, haptic feedback, or any latency-dependent application. Especially in the context of rapidly changing environment where the UAVs are moving fast, AI and/or QC would play a crucial role to achieve a dynamically adaptive network. Next-generation wireless networks offer more capacity for the conveyance of relevant information from onboard instruments such as cameras or thermal sensors. Thus, there shall be a need for the efficient processing of potentially copious amounts of raw data for relevant information. For example, to deploy a drone swarm in a search and rescue operation, the use of QC or AI could improve the processing of received visual information with respect to processing speed. The application of AI and QC for mm Wave-UAV communications is a promising research direction to break through the traditional communication paradigm and integrate communication, computing, and storage resources.

When designing quantum algorithms for such a distributed quantum computer, one can make use of the added parallelization and distribution abilities inherent in the system. An added difficulty to then overcome for distributed quantum computing is that a complex control system to orchestrate the various components is required. In this work, we aim to address these issues. We explicitly define what it means for a quantum algorithm to be distributed and then present various quantum algorithms that fit the definition. We discuss potential benefits and propose a high-level scheme for controlling the system. With this, we present our software framework called Interlin-q, a simulation platform that aims to simplify designing and verifying parallel and distributed quantum algorithms. We demonstrate Interlin-q by implementing some of the discussed algorithms using Interlin-q and layout future steps for developing Interlin-q into a control system for distributed quantum computers.

There are vast service chains in NFV to meet users' requests, which are composed of a sequence of network functions. These virtual network functions (VNFs) are implemented in virtual machines by software and virtual environment. How to deploy VMs to process VNFs of the service chains as soon as possible when users' requests are received is very challenging to solve by traditional algorithms on a large scale. Compared with traditional algorithms, quantum computing has better computational performance because of quantum parallelism. We build an integer linear programming model of the VNF scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing delays, and transfer it into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. Our proposed heuristic algorithm employs a quantum annealer to solve the model. Finally, we evaluate the computational results and explore the feasibility of leveraging quantum computing to solve the VNF scheduling problem.

In this paper, we find the key of the Caesar cipher, which is a classical cipher, by using a quantum machine learning algorithm that learns by parameterized quantum circuit instead of a classical neural network. In the case of 4-bit plaintext and key, results could not be obtained due to the limitations of the cloud environment. But in the case of 2-bit plaintext and key, an accuracy of 1.0 was achieved, and in the case of 3bit plaintext and key, an accuracy of 0.84 was achieved. In addition, as a result of cryptanalysis for a 2-bit dataset on IBM's real quantum processor, a classification accuracy of 0.93 was achieved. In the future, we will research a qubit reduction method for cryptanalysis of longer-length plaintext and key, and a technique for maintaining accuracy in real quantum hardware.

One of the notable examples is the introduction of IoT-based smart home services (SHS), which aims to provide ubiquitous sensing and intelligent control at home. Security is an important issue in SHS that needs to be resolved before it can receive wide adoption. In this paper, we propose BC-SHS, a consortium blockchain to protect the IoT-based SHS. The SHS within a community forms a consortium blockchain, while the cloud service provider (CSP) joins the consortium blockchain to provide services through smart contracts. External communication (between smart homes and cloud servers) goes through this consortium blockchain, which ensures integrity, authenticity, auditability and privacy preservation of SHSs. In addition to this, we analyse state of the art post-quantum signature schemes and propose to adopt pqNTRUsign as a replacement to the existing ECDSA signature scheme.

However, quantum communications are still vulnerable to errors and require quantum error corrections (QECC). This paper proposes quantum accumulate codes, where idea is coming from the classical accumulate codes that can provide good performances to remove or minimize the error-floor in classical communications. The proposed quantum codes can exactly satisfy both Hamming and Singleton bounds resulting in one of the smallest perfect quantum codes. This paper explains in details the steps to construct the codewords, syndrome extraction, error correction, and the quantum circuits. We perform a series of computer simulations to evaluate the quantum word error rate (QWR) and quantum fidelity performances under the depolarizing channels. Our results confirm that the stabilizers of the proposed codes can extract the syndrome and distinguish all error patterns of any single qubit errors of Pauli X, Y, and Z providing performances confirmed by the theoretical QWER curves. The results are expected to provide contributions to the development of quantum communications and future security issues.

Nevertheless, quantum computing may also jeopardize current cryptography standard schemes by solving the problems used in these schemes. Therefore, new quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives and installations are required for the near future. In this work, we present a hardware-based cryptographic accelerator that provides resistance to quantum computer attacks. Directly in VHDL, we design and implement essential cryptographic functions which can be loaded to our accelerator equipped with the FPGA board. Our solution provides efficient encryption, signing, and hashing operations for securing the input data or network packets. Moreover, we create a high-level software demonstrator for setting and using these operations in the accelerator. The presented results prove that cryptography functions accelerated in our hardware-based solution are more efficient than software implementations.

This paper addresses the necessary guidelines and assessments for future quantum solutions to the standard mobile cloud networks. In particular, using entanglement phenomenon to increase the performance of the X2 application (X2-AP) protocol by minimising the overhead signalling, represented by the time and energy consumption the conventional cloud encounters. We intended to offer a delay reduction while adapting the quantum technique into the cloud by modelling the latency of both paradigms. Finally, increasing the number of photons has decreased the delay to about 40% compared to the traditional network.

Recently, quantum methods for machine learning have attracted the interest of researchers. Those methods aim to exploit, in the context of machine learning, the potential benefits that the quantum computers should be able to offer in the near future. A particularly interesting area of research in this direction, investigates the union of quantum machine learning models with Convolutional Neural Networks. In this paper we develop a quantum counterpart of a 3D Convolutional Neural Network for video classification, dubbed Q3D-CNN. This is the first approach for quantum video classification we are aware of. Our model is based on previously proposed quantum machine learning models, where manipulation of the input data is performed in such a way that a fully quantum-mechanical neural network layer can be realized and used to form a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network. We augment this approach by introducing quantum-friendly operations during data-loading and appropriately manipulating the quantum network. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed Q3D-CNN in video classification using videos from a publicly available dataset. We successfully classify the test dataset using two and three classes using the quantum network and its classical counterpart.

309,2,C1,Rehm et al. (2021),2021,QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING for HEP DETECTOR SIMULATIONS,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,"Quantum Machine Learning (qML) is one of the most promising and very intuitive applications on near-term quantum devices which possess the potential to combat computing resource challenges faster than traditional computers. Classical Machine Learning (ML) is taking up a significant role in particle physics to speed up detector simulations. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to achieve a similar level of accuracy compared to Monte Carlo-based simulations while decreasing the computation time by orders of magnitude. In this research we are moving on and apply quantum computing to GAN-based detector simulations. Given the limitations of current quantum hardware in terms of number of qubits, connectivity, and noise, we perform initial tests with a simplified GAN model running on quantum simulators. The model is a classical-quantum hybrid ansatz. It consists of a quantum generator, defined as a parameterised circuit based on single and two qubit gates, combined with a classical discriminator. Our initial qGAN prototype focuses on a one-dimensional toy-distribution, representing the energy deposited in a detector by a single particle. It employs three qubits and achieves high physics accuracy thanks to hyper-parameter optimisation. Furthermore, we study the influence of real hardware noise for the qML GAN training. A second qGAN is developed to simulate 2D images with a 64-pixel resolution, representing the energy deposition patterns in the detector. Different quantum ansatzes are studied. We obtained the best results using a tree-tensor-network architecture with six qubits. Additionally, we discuss challenges and potential benefits of quantum computing as well as our plans for future developments. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 CEUR-WS.

As a representative deep learning framework, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been widely used for generating artificial images, text-to-image or image augmentation across areas of science, arts and video games. However, GANs are computationally expensive, sometimes computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, training GANs may suffer from convergence failure and modal collapse. Aiming at the acceleration of use cases for practical quantum computers, we propose QuGAN, a quantum GAN architecture that provides stable convergence, quantum-states based gradients and significantly reduced parameter sets. The QuGAN architecture runs both the discriminator and the generator purely on quantum state fidelity and utilizes the swap test on qubits to calculate the values of quantum-based loss functions.

This has attracted research interest from academia and the industry in the application of industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in the O&#x0026;G sector. The application of some of these I4.0 technologies has been presented in the literature, but the domain still lacks a comprehensive survey of the application of I4.0 in the O&#x0026;G upstream sector. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art efforts directed toward I4.0 technologies in the O&#x0026;G upstream sector. To achieve this, first, an overview of the I4.0 is discussed followed by a systematic literature review from an integrative perspective for publications between 2012-2021 with 223 analyzed documents. The benefits and challenges of the adoption of I4.0 have been identified. Moreover, the paper adds value by proposing a framework for the implementation of I4.0 in the O&#x0026;G upstream sector. Finally, future directions and research opportunities such as framework, edge computing, quantum computing, communication technologies, standardization, and innovative areas related to the implementation of I4.0 in the upstream sector are presented. The findings from this review show that I4.0 technologies are currently being explored and deployed for various aspects of the upstream sector. However, some of the I4.0 technologies like additive manufacturing and virtual reality are least explored.

(2021),2021,Effect of barren plateaus on gradient-free optimization,Quantum,10.22331/Q-2021-10-05-558,"Barren plateau landscapes correspond to gradients that vanish exponentially in the number of qubits. Such landscapes have been demonstrated for variational quantum algorithms and quantum neural networks with deep circuits, global cost functions, large entanglement, or hardware noise. For obvious reasons, it is expected that gradient-based optimizers will be significantly affected by barren plateaus. However, whether or not gradient-free optimizers are impacted is a topic of debate, with some arguing that gradient-free approaches are unaffected by barren plateaus. Here we show that, indeed, gradient-free optimizers do not solve the barren plateau problem. Our main result proves that cost function differences, which are the basis for making decisions in a gradient-free optimization, are exponentially suppressed in a barren plateau. Hence, without exponential precision, gradient-free optimizers will not make progress in the optimization. We numerically confirm this by training a parameterized quantum circuit in a barren plateau landscape with several gradient-free optimizers (Nelder-Mead, Powell, and COBYLA algorithms), and show that the number of shots required in the optimization grows exponentially with the number of qubits. These results provide new insight into the training landscapes of quantum neural networks and will inform the development of strategies to mitigate or avoid barren plateaus.

(2021),2021,Modular FSO optical system design for classical and quantum optical communication systems,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2599161,"Optical communication systems are picking up pace in the various industries for its many scenarios in which it can be used. This includes satellite, aircraft and ground systems for which the DLR Institute of Communications and Navigation develops laser terminals. Free Space Optics (FSO) based optical systems have different applications ranging from terrestrial to airborne to space, and thus associated requirements to these application domains vary even though primary functional goals remain the same. Furthermore, quantum communication became of interest for its inherently secure key generation process that allows two nodes to securely communicate with each other and share secrets for long term security. Out of the different use cases of free-space optical laser terminal came the concept of having a modular FSO optical system design that could quickly adapt to the changing needs from mission to mission. The idea of a modularity appeals to many despite its challenges in the beginning, but in the long run the pros outweigh the cons. The concept was realized by carefully studying different requirements from various on-going and past projects and thereafter segmenting different aspects of the optical system based on three main categories, namely; the received path, the transmitted path and the shared path. To elaborate modularity in system; a Fast Steering Mirror (FSM) can be replaced with a fold mirror for a simpler design if it is not required, or an exchangeable CPA with integrated telescope mounted at the aperture of the optical bench to allow for different magnifications and ex-aperture beam diameter, all these without major impact on other subsystems. This greatly reduces the effort involved in re-evaluating system performance in the long run. In this study, the design and development of such an optical system is presented that lays its ground in the Institute of Communications and NavigationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s OSIRIS project, but still continues to serve as the primary optical system design of choice for future projects.

Quantum conference key agreement (CKA) is an important cryptographic primitive of quantum cryptography, which provides the conference key among multiple users simultaneously. However, quantum CKA is currently far from practical application due to the low conference key rate. Here, we propose a quantum CKA protocol of three users with information-Theoretic security. Our protocol only requires phase-randomized weak coherent sources and threshold single-photon detectors, and is anticipated to be experimentally demonstrated over 600 km under current technology.

Classical Internet has laid its foundation originating from the amalgamation of mathematics and Claude Shannon's theory of information. However, today's Internet technology is a playground for eavesdroppers. This poses a serious challenge to various applications that rely on classical Internet technology, and it has motivated the researchers to switch to new technologies that are fundamentally more secure. By exploring the quantum effects, researchers paved the way into quantum networks that provide security, privacy, and range of capabilities such as quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The realization of Quantum Internet (QI) requires quantum communication between various remote nodes through quantum channels guarded by quantum cryptographic protocols. Such networks rely upon quantum bits (qubits) that can simultaneously take the value of zeros and ones. Due to the extraordinary properties of qubits such as superposition, entanglement, and teleportation, it gives an edge to quantum networks over traditional networks in many ways. At the same time, transmitting qubits over long distances is a formidable task and extensive research is going on satellite-based quantum communication, which will deliver breakthroughs for physically realizing QI in near future. In this paper, QI functionalities, technologies, applications and open challenges have been extensively surveyed to help readers gain a basic understanding of the infrastructure required for the development of the global QI.

(2021),2021,Cloud Education Chain and Education Quality Evaluation Based on Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Algorithm,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,10.1155/2021/1909345,"This paper proposes the functional model and application service implementation process of the education cloud platform application service architecture. The entire cloud application service architecture mainly includes four parts: cloud service management, cloud application service rapid creation and deployment, dynamic process configuration, and unified identity authentication. Based on the basic theory of workflow, the process status and business services of cloud application services are discussed. The BP neural network weight optimization model based on the improved quantum evolution method is studied, and a method that combines the improved quantum evolution algorithm (IQEA) and the BP algorithm to complete the back propagation neural network training is proposed, that is, the IQEA-BP algorithm. Firstly, the traditional quantum evolution algorithm is improved, and then, the improved quantum evolution algorithm is used to optimize the network weights as a whole to overcome the shortcomings of the BP algorithm that is easy to fall into the local optimum; then, we use the BP algorithm to find the better weight as the initial value to improve the training and prediction accuracy of the network. In order to enrich the school education quality evaluation system, this article adds soft indicators that can reflect school education performance on the basis of the existing ""National Education Inspection Team""indicators and uses analytical methods to prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the new evaluation indicators. The X1-X10 index data is selected as the evaluation index of the school education quality evaluation system in this paper. Testing the performance of the BP neural network, the accuracy rate of the school education quality evaluation is 93.3%, the average absolute error is 0.067, and the accuracy and recall rate of the test set grade gradient of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 are all 93%, indicating that the IQEA-BP neural network algorithm has a good effect on the evaluation of school education quality.

(2021),2021,Towards a complete software stack to integrate Quantum Key Distribution in a cloud environment,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3102313,"The coming advent of Quantum Computing promises to jeopardize current communications security, undermining the effectiveness of traditional public-key based cryptography. Different strategies (Post-Quantum or Quantum Cryptography) have been proposed to address this problem. Many techniques and algorithms based on quantum phenomena have been presented in recent years; the most relevant example is the introduction of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This approach allows to exchange cryptographic keys among parties and does not suffer from the development of quantum computation. Problems arise when this technique has to be deployed and combined with modern distributed infrastructures that heavily depend on cloud and virtualisation paradigms. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a new software stack that effortlessly introduces QKD in such environments and involves a simulation tool for Quantum Key Distribution. This software stack allows for agnostic integration, monitoring, and management of QKD, independent from a specific vendor or technology. Furthermore, a QKD simulator is presented, designed, and tested. This latter contribution is suitable as a low-level testing device, as an independent software module to check QKD protocols, and as a testbed to identify future practical enhancements.

However, the insatiable demand for computing resources required to train these models is fast outpacing the advancement of classical computing hardware, and new frameworks including Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) and quantum computing are being explored as future alternatives. In this work, we report a novel quantum computing based deep learning model, the Quantum Optical Convolutional Neural Network (QOCNN), to alleviate the computational bottleneck in future computer vision applications. Using the MNIST dataset, we have benchmarked this new architecture against a traditional CNN model based on the seminal LeNet architecture. We have also compared the performance against previously reported ONNs, the GridNet and ComplexNet, and a Quantum Optical Neural Network (QONN) that we built by combining the ComplexNet with quantum-inspired sinusoidal nonlinearities. Our work extends the prior research on QONN by adding quantum convolution and pooling layers. We have evaluated the models using the metrics of accuracies, confusion matrices, Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, and Matthews Correlation Coefficients. The performance of the models were similar, and the metrics indicated that the new QOCNN model is robust. Finally, we estimated the gains in computational efficiencies from executing this novel framework on a quantum computer, concluding that switching to a quantum computing based approach to deep learning may result in comparable accuracies to classical models while simultaneously achieving unprecedented boosts in computational performances and power allocation.

QuNetSim addresses this need. QuNetSim is a Python software framework that delivers an easy-to-use interface for simulating quantum networks at the network layer, which can be extended at little effort of the user to implement the corresponding link layer protocols. The goal of QuNetSim is to make it easier to investigate and test quantum networking protocols over various quantum network configurations and parameters. The framework incorporates many known quantum network protocols so that users can quickly build simulations using a quantum-networking toolbox in a few lines of code and so that beginners can easily learn to implement their own quantum networking protocols. Unlike most current tools, QuNetSim simulates with real time and is, therefore, well suited to control laboratory hardware. Here, we present a software design overview of QuNetSim and demonstrate examples of protocols implemented with it. We describe ongoing work, which uses QuNetSim as a library, and describe possible future directions for the development of QuNetSim.

Although the country has yet established a truly global space-based Internet, the development of frontier technology makes the space-based network feasible. In this paper, we proposed a novel system architecture of SGIN adopting the cutting-edge technologies of new communication transmission, plug and play satellite module, flexible configuration effective carrier, modular network system, and multi-satellite launch. The paper further analyses the role of new technologies in promoting space-based networks from the aspects of performance and cost and puts forward the development trend of space-based network technology.

With the novel architecture design and demonstration of the promising trends, we believe this paper will guide the future research of high-impact research in SGIN.

327,1,C1,Otgonbaatar & Datcu (2021),2021,Quantum annealer for network flow minimization in InSAR images,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar, EUSAR",,"Quantum Annealer (QA) is well-suited for a certain class of optimization problems which can be expressed as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. A QUBO problem belongs to the family of Integer Programming problems which are called the NP-hard optimization problems. Feasible solutions of such problems can be found by using classical optimization techniques. However, studies claim that QA can find a feasible global solution that is faster than a classical annealer for QUBO problems. Hence, it appears promising to program and use the QA-to-QUBO approach for Earth Observation. In search of the QUBO problem in the domain of Earth Observation, we examined several Inteferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications and identified a residue connection problem in the phase unwrapping procedure. In particular, we consider the residue connection problem with multiples of 2p as a QUBO problem. For this practical problem, we studied how to formulate this QUBO problem, and we examined the challenges to program the D-Wave quantum annealer, in particular, embedding the QUBO problem into our QA architecture with a so-called Pegasus topology, and the annealing parameter settings in the D-Wave quantum annealer. We then analysed the parameter effects on finding the global minimum of the residue connection problem. From these results, we derived and enhanced our insight for programming future quantum annealers; for instance, choosing real-world problems in Earth Observation, conceiving the embedding procedure, and the tuning of the annealing parameters.

The Cambridge Quantum Network has been operating for several years with 3 nodes separated by between 5-10 km of installed fibre. All links are secured by QKD systems operating with secure key rates in excess of 1 Mb/s, the highest recorded long term key rates in a deployed network. The network operates in the presence of 100Gb/s classical traffic with no significant reduction of secure key generation rate. In addition, the Bristol Quantum Network has four nodes 1-3km apart connected in a mesh protected by two pairs of QKD systems. The network is designed to be very dynamic, switching both QKD and WDM classical traffic to enable rapid reconfiguration and is used as a testbed for QKD protected dynamic applications. The two metropolitan networks are being connected by a 410 km QKD link, with 4 spans, the longest of which operates over 129km of fibre with an attenuation of 28dB achieving secure key rates of 2.7kb/s, the longest and highest loss QKD field trial to date. A 120km extension of the UK quantum network from Cambridge to BT Labs, Adastral Park operates with fully commercially available components and is an important testbed comprising 3 intermediate nodes and operates with 5 x 100Gb/s classical channels. This helps determine how to proceed with a large-scale commercial deployment of QKD.

With the ever present demand for higher communication data rates and larger bandwidth required by future space exploration missions, optimization of the communications systems supporting such missions is necessary to ensure that critical scientific data and high definition video and imagery of human and robotic exploration is properly transmitted back to Earth. In the aeronautics side, the envisioned increase in aircraft volumes under the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) ecosystems could benefit from communications capabilities impervious to interference and free from spectrum limitations constraints. This work discusses examples of GRC's ongoing technology development and integration efforts relevant to the aforementioned scenarios. In particular, the ability to increase the versatility, affordability, and reliability of ground-based optical receivers for space-to-ground communications will be presented. Our current activities on the development of highly secure airborne laser communications links augmented with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) will also be discussed, as well as scenarios in which optical communications could be beneficial to UAM/AAM.

First of all, this paper analyzes the problem in theory, and transforms the characteristics of the problem into a mathematical model. The mathematical model considers that the sensor network itself is a travelling salesman problem (TSP), but also requires the shortest path of the mobile sink node. Then, the path of each node in the sensor network is iterated by quantum annealing algorithm, and an optimal TSP path is obtained by using quantum tunneling effect and quantum circuit to achieve parallelism. Finally, in the case of compressing the solution space, the moving path of the mobile sink node is quantum coded, and the Hamiltonian in the quantum annealing algorithm is taken as the guiding factor, and then the individual dimensions are moved, which improves the accuracy of the algorithm and speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, the feasibility of EMGH is verified by simulation experiments and comparison with other algorithms, which provides a reference for the optimization and improvement of path planning method.

It can provide a high-speed Ethernet encryption while supporting the virtualization of a large network such as data center network. Although MACsec addresses most of security threats, it is not immune against quantum attacks which are a future, yet disastrous threat against public-key cryptography in use. In this paper, we demonstrate a new solution for a MACsec protocol over VXLAN in a post-quantum setting. Instead of a standard MACsec key agreement protocol, we use an ephemeral key exchange protocol and an end-to-end authentication scheme, both of which are based on post-quantum cryptography. To measure the impact on the performance, we established a quantum-secure link between Germany and Israel using MACsec in VXLAN over public IP networks. We verified that the impact on the latency and throughput is minimal. Our experiment confirms that quantum-secure virtualized links can be already established in a long-distance without changing their infrastructure.

To provide a long-term security, the MACsec protocol should be resistant to future attacks including quantum attacks. In this paper,MACsec is analysed under a quantum attack scenario. To achieve 128-bit quantum security, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithms defined in MACsec should mandate to use 256-bit keys. On the other hand, classical publickey cryptosystems in MKA are not secure at all against quantum attacks so that they need to be replaced by post-quantum crypto schemes in a quantum world.We propose an authenticated post-quantum key establishment protocol which is suitable for long-term secure MACsec. The proposed protocol is used in the hybrid mode, an ephemeral key exchange, and an end-to-end encryption. We verified by experiments that the proposed protocol can be deployed in existing a MACsec-enabled Ethernet network.

With billions of connected devices spanning continents through interconnected networks, security and privacy protection techniques for the emerging II services become a paramount concern. In this paper, an up-to-date privacy method mapping and relevant use cases are surveyed for II services. Particularly, we emphasize on post-quantum cryptography techniques that may (or must when quantum computers become a reality) be used in the future through concrete products, pilots, and projects. The topics presented in this paper are of utmost importance as (1) several recent regulations such as Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have given privacy a significant place in digital society, and (2) the increase of IoT/II applications and digital services with growing data collection capabilities are introducing new threats and risks on citizens' privacy. This in-depth survey begins with an overview of security and privacy threats in IoT/IIs. Next, we summarize some selected Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) suitable for privacy-concerned II services, and then map recent PET schemes based on post-quantum cryptographic primitives which are capable of withstanding quantum computing attacks. This paper also overviews how PETs can be deployed in practical use cases in the scope of IoT/IIs, and maps some current projects, pilots, and products that deal with PETs.

Simultaneous information transmissions of the base station and the users are regarded as same-frequency interference against interception by eavesdroppers. To promote energy conservation and improve utilization of system resources, we propose a joint antenna selection and power allocation (JASPA) strategy for CCFD massive MIMO networks. Considering the trade-off between secrecy performance and system communications quality, we formulate optimization functions based on JASPA for two security concerns. We design a quantum-inspired backtracking search algorithm (QBSA) to obtain the optimal JASPA scheme. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed QBSA is superior to previous intelligent algorithms in CCFD massive MIMO systems. The effectiveness of the proposed JASPA scheme is demonstrated under various communications scenarios, and can be considered a cornerstone for future research in wireless communications domain.

(2021),2021,On the Role of Hash-Based Signatures in Quantum-Safe Internet of Things: Current Solutions and Future Directions,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2020.3013019,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining ground as a pervasive presence around us by enabling miniaturized 'things' with computation and communication capabilities to collect, process, analyze, and interpret information. Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication in IoT is based on public-key cryptosystems such as the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless, the reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this article, we investigate applications of one of the postquantum signatures called hash-based signature (HBS) schemes for the security of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of HBS schemes with an emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of HBS schemes and their significance for IoT security in the quantum era. We also investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along with possible solutions. Finally, we outline the essential measures and recommendations that must be adopted by the IoT ecosystem while preparing for the quantum world.

Findings: The conceptual model of corporate database management on the basis of cloud, quantum, blockchain technologies and big data processing technologies on the principles of efficiency and security was developed. Scenario analysis of corporate database management on the principles of efficiency and security in the regions of the North Caucasus Federal District of the Russian Federation with the application of game theory methodology was conducted. Originality/value: It has been substantiated that the management of corporate databases based on cloud, quantum, blockchain and big data technologies to meet the criteria of efficiency and security should be organized in a systematic manner and be based on the capabilities of the region. This forms a fundamentally new scientific concept of the organization of the process under study, which reflects the view on it not from the standpoint of an isolated enterprise, but from the standpoint of the regionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enterprises. Owing to this, security is provided with the support of the state, the risks are distributed among the enterprises of the region and full-scale financing allows maximizing the advantages. Circulation of regional enterprises allows establishing electronic document circulation and formation of an integral network of corporate databases in the region, thus further increasing management efficiency.

However, no effective method for predicting the demand for museum tourism has yet emerged. In order to be able to build a prediction model that can perceive the needs of museum tourists, this article uses advanced algorithms based on neural network integration and calls different algorithms: QPSO-BPNN, QPSO, PSO, PSO-BPNN, and BPNN. When the training ratio increases to 90%, the prediction accuracy of the three algorithms, BPNN, PSO, and PSO-BPNN, is less than 80%, and the prediction accuracy of the QPSO-BPNN algorithm has reached 92.5%. Under the condition of equal training set ratio, the prediction accuracy of QPSO-BPNN algorithm is always significantly higher than that of PSO-BPNN algorithm. When the training set proportions are 50%, 70%, and 90%, the changes in population size parameters have little effect on the prediction accuracy of the algorithm. Based on the above experiments, it is known that the QPSO-BPNN algorithm is less sensitive to the size of the population, and the algorithm has good robustness. With the increase in the number of initial classifiers, the prediction accuracy of the QPSO-BPNN algorithm has improved significantly. The experimental results are consistent with the previous theoretical derivation analysis, and the accuracy of the algorithm has a positive correlation with the number of classifiers.

However, few works have been addressed on the performance and feasibility for RFI-QKD in turbulent atmospheric channels. Here, we propose to implement RFI-QKD in practical free-space links with fluctuating transmission efficiency due to beam wandering and broadening. An improved model for estimating the probability distribution of single-photon receiving efficiency has been developed and we also simulated the Gaussian beam spot evolution and secure key rate based on that. Results show that the beam wandering model of probability distribution of transmission efficiency is reasonable to improve the performance of RFI-QKD in free-space channel.

Quantum communication based on the Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state measurement provides a practical way to implement multiparty quantum communication. With the standard spatially localized GHZ state measurement, however, information can be imbalanced among the communication parties that can cause significant problems in some applications of multiparty cryptographic communication, e.g., secret sharing. Here, we propose an equitable multiparty quantum communication where information balance among the communication parties is achieved without a trusted third party. Our scheme is based on the GHZ state measurement that is not spatially localized but implemented in a way that all the distant communication parties symmetrically participate. We also verify the feasibility of our scheme by presenting the proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of informationally balanced three-party quantum communication using weak coherent pulses.

(2020),2020,Refining aerosol optical depth retrievals over land by constructing the relationship of spectral surface reflectances through deep learning: Application to Himawari-8,Remote Sensing of Environment,10.1016/j.rse.2020.112093,"For the past two decades, quantitative retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been made from both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, and the results have been widely used in numerous studies. Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of AOD retrievals, there are still major challenges, especially over land. A notable one for the so-called Dark-Target (DT) algorithms is building the surface reflectance (SR) relationships (SRR) to derive SR in the visible channels from SR in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channel, mainly because these relationships are strongly subjected to entangled factors (e.g., viewing geometry, surface type, and vegetation state). In this study, we examine the benefits of a new method for deriving the SRR using deep learning techniques. The SRR constructed by the deep neural network (DNN) considers multiple related inputs, such as the SWIR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVISWIR), viewing geometry, and seasonality, among others. We then incorporate the DNN-constrained SRR into a DT algorithm developed at NOAA/STAR to retrieve AOD from the Advanced Himawari Instrument (AHI) onboard the new generation of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8. The revised DT algorithm with the deep learning technique (DTDL) demonstrates improved performance over the study region (95ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“125Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°E, 18ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“30Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°N, a portion of the AHI full disk), as attested by significantly reduced random noise, especially for low NDVISWIR and high surface albedo cases. Robust independent tests indicate that this algorithm can be applied to untrained regions, not only to those used in training. The method directly benefits the algorithm development for Himawari-8 and can also be adopted for other geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence could significantly improve AOD retrievals from multi-spectral satellite observations following this new approach.

345,2,C1,Jeevaraj (2020),2020,"A modern IoT based intelligent healthcare process architecture, analysis and deployment",Journal of Green Engineering,,"Blockchain technology can be used in almost all fields due to its strengths such as symmetric encryption, openness, immutability, and the decentralised data network. Currently, an intelligent medical infrastructure with a blockchain computer system and healthcare processes offers openness, simple and rapid connectivity, protection, efficiency, etc. Healthcare is a development that encompasses manufacturing processes like IoT, IoT, computational engineering, quantum computing, big data, cloud technology, edging, etc. The purpose of this project is to create an intelligent health infrastructure which is illustrated through BlockchainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and healthcareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s convergence and interoperability in the sense of basic healthcare. Health procedures used for data accessibility are aimed at validating these processes via methods and algorithms for numerical computation. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s implemented in the network of Ethereum and related programming languages and techniques like solidity, web3.js and Athena etc the blockchain is implemented. In addition, this report prepares a comparative survey of state-of-the-art smart health care programmes focused on blockchain. The whole analysis contains methods, implementations, criteria, performance, future directions etc. A list of predominantly Electronic Health Record (EHR), Telemedicine or Digital Personal Records (DPR) groups, institutions and enterprises is drawn up and contextual research surrounding the use of blockchain technologies for their operations. This research investigates optimisation algorithms for trends in healthcare and increases the efficiency of open blockchain-based technologies for the intelligent healthcare system. In addition, the proposed framework for accelerating confidence building and payment processes prepares intelligent contracts and strategies. In order to test the methodology presented, the thesis envisaged simulation and execution. Effects of the simulation suggest that the appropriate gas value (indicating block size and expenses) is within the established limits for Gas EtherumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s network. The device suggested is active since the use of the block is over 80%. The smart contract is less than 20 seconds immediately executed. In a method that demonstrates a competitive health care market, a good number (mean 4 by simulation period) is created. Although simulation and deployment errors of 0.55 to 4.24 percent exist, they do not impact device output overall because simulated and real data differences (acceptance of state-of-the-art) are marginal.

Conventional encryption algorithm oriented cryptology would be hacked by cryptanalysis, hence is challenging to provide unconditional security. To tackle this unprecedented issue, quantum key distribution (QKD) has been envisioned as a promising physical layer security technology for the upcoming 6G era due to the unique properties of quantum physics, i.e., no-cloning and uncertainty. To accommodate as many security-sensitive applications as possible, in this letter, the secure key rate maximization problem for QKD enabled communication networks is investigated. By transforming the original problem into a maximum weight perfect matching problem of an undirected and non-bipartite graph, the associated quantum devices scheduling policy is optimally determined, along with the feasibility analysis as well as two simpler heuristic scheduling approaches. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the devised scheduling strategies from comprehensive perspectives, such as achievable secure key rate and outage probability.

Security issues, including attack management, have become increasingly important for optical communication networks because of the vulnerabilities associated with tapping light from optical fibre links. Physical layer security often requires restricting access to channels and periodic inspections of link performance. In this paper, we report how quantum communication techniques can be utilized to detect a physical layer attack. We present an efficient method for monitoring the physical layer security of a high-data-rate classical optical communication network using a modulated continuous-variable quantum signal. We describe the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of this monitoring system and the monitoring accuracy for different monitored parameters. We analyse its performance for both unamplified and amplified optical links. The technique represents a novel approach for applying quantum signal processing to practical optical communication networks and compares well with classical monitoring methods. We conclude by discussing the challenges facing its practical application, its differences with respect to existing quantum key distribution methods, and its usage in future secure optical transport network planning.

In this paper we study a quantum reservoir computer (QRC), a framework harnessing quantum dynamics and designed for fast and efficient solving of temporal machine learning tasks such as speech recognition, time series prediction and natural language processing. Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and find that its faster decay implies a more accurate memory. Furthermore, as an example application on real world data, we use QRC to predict stock values.

Although HLS tools are becoming popular in some applications, such as digital signal processing and neural network classification, their usability on cryptographic applications is largely unexplored. This feasibility is critical especially for cryptosystems that are under development, such as the next-generation public-key cryptosystems needed for quantum-resistance. This letter provides a thorough investigation of HLS on number theoretic transform (NTT) - the core arithmetic function of lattice-based quantum-resistant cryptosystems. We demonstrate a fast yet extensive design space exploration of NTT through the Vivado HLS tool, analyze the shortcomings/challenges of optimized configurations, and quantitatively compare the results to software-based and hand-coded hardware designs.

(2020),2020,Scheduling of space to ground quantum key distribution,EPJ Quantum Technology,10.1140/epjqt/s40507-020-0079-6,"Satellite-based platforms are currently the only feasible way of achieving intercontinental range for quantum communication, enabling thus the future global quantum internet. Recent demonstrations by the Chinese spacecraft Micius have spurred an international space race and enormous interest in the development of both scientific and commercial systems. Research efforts so far have concentrated upon in-orbit demonstrations involving a single satellite and one or two ground stations. Ultimately satellite quantum key distribution should enable secure network communication between multiple nodes, which requires efficient scheduling of communication with the set of ground stations. Here we present a study of how satellite quantum key distribution can service many ground stations taking into account realistic constraints such as geography, operational hours, and most importantly, weather conditions. The objective is to maximise the number of keys a set of ground stations located in the United Kingdom could share while simultaneously reflecting the communication needs of each node and its relevance in the network. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimisation program and solved to a desired optimality gap using a state of the art solver. The approach is presented using a simulation run throughout six years to investigate the total number of keys that can be sent to ground stations.

A Structured Design Exploration to the Monolithic vs Distributed Architectures Quest,"2020 35th Conference on Design of Circuits and Integrated Systems, DCIS 2020",10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268630,"Being a very promising technology, with impressive advances in the recent years, it is still unclear how quantum computing will scale to satisfy the requirements of its most powerful applications. Although continued progress in the fabrication and control of qubits is required, quantum computing scalability will depend as well on a comprehensive architectural design considering a distributed multi-core approach as an alternative to the traditional monolithic version, hence including a communications perspective. However, this goes beyond introducing mere interconnects. Rather, it implies consolidating the full communications stack in the quantum computer structure. In this paper, we propose a double full-stack architecture encompassing quantum computation and quantum communications, which we use to address the monolithic versus distributed question with a structured design methodology. For that, we revisit the different quantum computing layers to capture and model their essence by highlighting the open design variables and performance metrics. Using behavioral models and actual measurements from existing quantum computers, the results of simulations suggest that multicore architectures may effectively unleash the full quantum computer potential.

In this paper, we first propose a new multi-GPU programming methodology called MG-BSP which constructs a virtual BSP machine on top of modern multi-GPU platforms, and apply this methodology to build a multi-GPU density matrix quantum simulator called DM-Sim. We propose a new formulation that can significantly reduce communication overhead, and show that this formula transformation can conserve the semantics despite noise being introduced. We build the tool-chain for the simulator to run open standard quantum assembly code, execute synthesized quantum circuits, and perform ultra-deep and largescale simulations. We evaluated DM-Sim on several state-of-theart multi-GPU platforms including NVIDIA's PascaUVolta DGX1, DGX-2, and ORNL's Summit supercomputer. In particular, we have demonstrated the simulation of one million general gates in 94 minutes on DGX-2, far deeper circuits than has been demonstrated in prior works. Our simulator is more than 10x faster with respect to the corresponding state-vector quantum simulators on GPUs and other platforms. The DM-Sim simulator is released at: http:llgithub.comlpnnllDM-Sim.

Market operations such as bidding, hedging, planning of facility investments and negotiation of bilateral contracts are rely on electricity price. Electricity price uncertainty is the major barrier in profit maximization of market participants. This price uncertainty can be addressed by using accurate forecasts in market operations. Artificial intelligence and time series-based models are used for day ahead electricity price forecasting. Such models necessitate massive training inputs for accurate forecasting, which leads to high processing time. However, fast and accurate forecasts are required for real time decision making in market operations. Therefore, this paper proposes three support vector regression forecasting models for day ahead electricity price forecasting. Proposed models use limited quantum of training inputs as they use similar day approach for forecasting. Also, proposed model use GA and PSO based hyper parameter optimization for improving forecasting accuracy. Data collected from Indian power market is used for performance evaluation. Performance of proposed models are compared with linear regression and artificial neural network models. Results show that proposed models have very strong potential towards day ahead electricity price forecasting.

Therefore, those challenges must be resolved by the next generation, 6G. Although features such as extremely high data rate is important, it is even more important to plan the security at this phase. In this paper, we propose to use traditional public key cryptography in 6G instead of experimental technologies such as quantum communications, artificial intelligence, or blockchain. We do so by utilizing the subscriber identity module (SIM) to store the cryptographic keys needed for authentication. While the capabilities of current SIMs are limited by their physical attributes, future SIM technologies such as eSIM show great promise to enable sufficient resources for our scheme as they are virtual. The proposed scheme is simpler, easy to implement, requires no third party, cost effective, and utilizes algorithms that have proven their security for decades.

Information traveling in the network needs security and privacy. There are various cryptographic algorithms available today that can secure messages and data being communicated. Symmetric cryptography, though simple, does not provide authorization efficiently. Asymmetric cryptography proves to be more secure as it provides all the components of information security.With the breakthrough development on the Internet-of- Things (IOT), any digital device can become an originator of data. The main concern which arises is how to protect these data. With an accelerated usage of IoT environment, the security of data collected and stored by these devices has become more crucial.In this paper, we discuss two asymmetric algorithms NTRU (Nth degree truncated polynomial ring) and RSA (Rivest- Shamir-Adleman) in context of IoT. RSA is widely used but is heavy on key size and computation complexity. On the other hand, NTRU can give the same level of bit security with comparative key size and very less computational complexity. The captivity of NTRU algorithm lies in the fact that it works on simple polynomial operations. It is a NP-hard problem based on shortest vector problem (SVP) and is secure even for future quantum attacks. In a resource constrained environment like IoT environment, the performance of RSA and NTRU has been analyzed on the various security level parameters, viz. key generation, encryption and decryption time. Furthermore, performance of the various parameters has also been analyzed on various bits size plain text.

In future quantum networks, generating secret keys in an anonymous way is of tremendous importance for parties that want to keep their shared key secret and at the same time protect their own identity. We provide a definition of anonymity for general protocols and present a CKA protocol that is provably anonymous under realistic adversarial scenarios. We base our protocol on shared Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, which have been proposed as more efficient resources for CKA protocols, compared to bipartite entangled resources. The existence of secure and anonymous protocols based on multipartite entangled states provides a new insight on their potential as resources and paves the way for further applications.

Moreover, we also add connections from the input layer to the output layer to increase the non-linear expression ability of the network and the similarity to the human brain's information processing. The specific steps and relevant formulas of the conjugate gradient algorithm in the learning stage of the quantum network parameters are also given in this paper.

Measurement-device-independent quantum secure direct communication (MDIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“QSDC) is immune to all the attacks at detectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s side and thus can eliminate the security loopholes associated with measurement devices. Existing MDIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“QSDC protocols encode secure information in only one degree of freedom (DOF) of photons. In this paper, we propose a high-capacity MDIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“QSDC protocol by encoding secure information in photonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ polarization and spatial-mode DOFs. With hyper-encoding in two DOFs, we can double photonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ channel capacity and effectively increase MDIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“QSDCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s communication efficiency. Moreover, for each encoded qudit, the states in two DOFs are totally independent. If a detection failure or error occurs on one DOF, the state in the other DOF can still be used to transmit secure information. This hyper-encoding MDIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“QSDC may have potential applications in future quantum communication.

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and - due to their long life span - also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), namely NewHope, NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and Saber. We implement our resulting quantum-resistant modifications of OPC UA on two different ARM based platforms and present detailed performance footprints. Finally, we show the feasibility of employing hybrid quantum-resistant key exchange within OPC UA preserving industrial communication against future threats.

It is suitable for building a star-type quantum access network, where the complicated and expensive measurement devices are placed in the central untrusted relay and each user requires only a low-cost transmitter, such as an integrated photonic chip. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 1.25-GHz silicon photonic chip-based MDI QKD system using polarization encoding. The photonic chip transmitters integrate the necessary encoding components for a standard QKD source. We implement random modulations of polarization states and decoy intensities, and demonstrate a finite-key secret rate of 31 bit/s over 36-dB channel loss (or 180-km standard fiber). This key rate is higher than state-of-the-art MDI QKD experiments. The results show that silicon photonic chip-based MDI QKD, benefiting from miniaturization, low-cost manufacture, and compatibility with CMOS microelectronics, is a promising solution for future quantum secure networks.

Due to its robustness, quantum computing can enrich the classical with other dimensions, security and cryptic-natured. However, the awareness about how to fully bridge the classical and quantum communications is not fully realised. In other words, the quantum phenomena are not totally utilised within the classical dimension. This work rather discusses directions and evaluations for future quantum solutions to traditional cloud mobile networks. Particularly, using quantum correlation phenomena to enhance the performance of X2 application protocol (X2-AP) by reducing the signalling overhead regarding the delay and power consumption that classical cloud encounter. Through modelling the latency of both paradigms using 'MATLAB', this work promises a delay reduction when adapting quantum method into the cloud. This study also models the power consumption and energy efficiency of traditional and quantum-based cloud networks. This work also shows, via modelling the power consumption, that installing a quantum-based paradigm is not a power costly method; rather, it shows identical power and energy efficiency figures with a possibility of improvement.

In the near future, classical algorithms used to construct KEMs, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography, will be vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. Recently, Yamada et al. proposed the quasicyclic medium density parity check (QC-MDPC) KEM, which is considered one of the most advanced code-based cryptosystems to resist quantum attacks. In this article, an optimized implementation of QC-MDPC KEM for IoT applications is presented. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) the fastest QC-MDPC McEliece decryption in field-programmable gate array (FPGA); 2) the first QC-MDPC KEM implementation in FPGA; and 3) the first iteration count attack-resistant QC-MDPC decoder in FPGA. To improve the decryption speed, we introduce a novel customized rotation engine (CRE) and incorporated several recent techniques reported in the literature, including adaptive threshold and Hamming weight estimation. The best-achieved throughput in our implementation on Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA is 12.7% faster than the state-of-the-art result reported by Heyse et al. The proposed CRE was then integrated with QC-MDPC KEM to produce a fast and secure KEM. Furthermore, to prevent timing attacks demonstrated recently, a constant-time implementation of the QC-MDPC McEliece decoder was presented.

A quantum cryptosystem is secure against cloning, and is thus immune to many types of traditional network attacks. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology based on a game theory consensus, and has already shown significant advantages in terms of data security. In this study, a method to extend the use of quantum and blockchain technologies in the security of IoV is considered. Herein, we present a semi-quantum system with a blockchain architecture and provide two lightweight approaches for its application to IoV with unconditional security and a single round of completion. Moreover, with our two protocols, only two modular exponentiations are applied, and the remaining computations are hash or XOR operations, which can be ignored. The results of our study may provide a guide for future applications toward IoV in the era of quantum and blockchain technologies.

In the multipartite setting, similar questions of the optimally achievable rates of transforming one pure state into another are notoriously open. This seems particularly unfortunate in the light of the revived interest in such questions due to the perspective of experimentally realizing multipartite quantum networks. In this Letter, we report substantial progress by deriving simple upper and lower bounds on the rates that can be achieved in asymptotic multipartite entanglement transformations. These bounds are based on ideas of entanglement combing and state merging. We identify cases where the bounds coincide and hence provide the exact rates. As an example, we bound rates at which resource states for the cryptographic scheme of quantum secret sharing can be distilled from arbitrary pure tripartite quantum states. This result provides further scope for quantum internet applications, supplying tools to study the implementation of multipartite protocols over quantum networks.

Similar to quantum key distribution (QKD), in practical applications, QSDC may suffer from attacks from imperfect detector. Measurement-device-independent QSDC (MDI-QSDC) can remove all attacks at detector's side and close all loopholes in the detection system. However, existing MDI-QSDC protocols have relatively low capacity. In this paper, we propose a high-capacity MDI-QSDC protocol of multiple degrees of freedom of a single photon. Compared with original MDI-QSDC protocols, our protocol has larger channel capacity which can use a single photon to transmit multi-bit of secure information. This protocol may have potential application in future quantum secure communication.

Quantum cryptography is an already available solution able to guarantee information theoretic secure communication in multiple environment, i.e. free-space, fiber and space link. Yet, the implementation of quantum communications in the aquatic scenario is still a relatively new and unexplored field of research. This paper provides a feasibility analysis of various quantum key distribution protocols simulated in the water medium, by performing an evaluation of their secret key rate, external noise sources and wind effect on the surface of the water. Three different links are considered: line-of-sight, non line-of-sight and free-space to underwater channels. The outcomes of this analysis suggest that underwater quantum communication can be implemented by adopting several protocols in all three scenarios.

However, the existing recognition algorithms of malicious transaction behaviors only rely on traditional malicious features, resulting in low recognition efficiency. This paper proposes a novel technique for identifying collaborative malicious network behavior in e-commerce: the quantum behavior-based particle swarm optimization method with global search capability, which is combined with the rapidly converging k-means method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. The paper first illustrates that the current malicious network behavior is diversified and collaborative, it is necessary to identify malicious network behavior from a higher level-cooperation level, and then proposes original cooperative malicious behavior features of e-commerce. Second, the use of information transfer entropy (ITE) based on quantum potential energy is introduced to designate the node with the largest ITE in the cluster as the cluster center, avoiding randomly initializing cluster center nodes and calculating the distance repeatedly. Third, the existence of collaborative malicious network behavior and the feasibility of the algorithm are proved using the fixed point theorem in the probability metric space. Meanwhile, quantum behavior-based particle swarm optimization is used to extract cluster centers as a means of improving the spatial distribution and collaborative state of particle nodes, and enables the clustering algorithm to have global search ability. The simulation results demonstrate that the our schemes improve the efficiency and accuracy of identifying cooperative malicious network behavior in e-commerce recognition.

The low-temperature states of such endofullerenes are described by quantum mechanical rotors, which are candidates for quantum information devices with higher-dimensional local Hilbert spaces. The experimental exploration of endofullerene arrays comes at a time when machine learning techniques are rapidly being adopted to characterize, verify, and reconstruct quantum states from measurement data. In this paper, we develop a strategy for reconstructing the ground state of chains of dipolar rotors using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) adapted to train on data from higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate accurate generation of energy expectation values from an RBM trained on data in the free-rotor eigenstate basis and explore the learning resources required for various chain lengths and dipolar interaction strengths. Finally, we show evidence for fundamental limitations in the accuracy achievable by RBMs due to the difficulty in imposing symmetries in the sampling procedure. We discuss possible avenues to overcome this limitation in the future, including the further development of autoregressive models such as recurrent neural networks for the purposes of quantum state reconstruction.

Several HD-QKD experiments have been demonstrated over deployed fibers to show promising future toward high-dimensional quantum communication networks. However, the practical security of HD-QKD systems should be widely considered before large-scale application of HD-QKD systems. In this paper, we focus on the HD-QKD based on the dispersive optics (DO-QKD) with both statistical and intensity fluctuations. For the condition only with statistical fluctuations, we present the parameter estimation based on an improved Chernoff bound. When considering the condition with both statistical and intensity fluctuations, we present the parameter estimation based on AzumaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inequality. By numerical simulations, we find that the parameter estimation for DO-QKD based on the improved Chernoff bound is tighter than the previous work in terms of the secret-key capacity and the maximum transmission distance. Moreover, we find that intensity fluctuations affect the performance of DO-QKD greatly and the effect on smaller data size is more obvious.

Applications of machine learning are inexhaustible, including recognizing patterns, predicting future trends and making decisions, and they are capable of handling sizable quantities of multi-dimensional data in the form of large vectors and tensors. To perform these operations on classical computers, however, requires vast time and computational resources. Unlike the classical computers that rely on computations using binary bits, Quantum Computers (QC) benefit from qubits which can hold combinations of 0 and 1 at the same time via superposition and entanglement. This makes QCs powerful at handling and post processing large tensors, making them a prime target for implementing ML algorithms. While several models used for ML on QCs are based on concepts from their classical computing counterparts, utilization of the QC's potential has made them the superior of the two. This paper presents an overview of the current state of knowledge in application of ML on QC, and evaluates the speed up, and complexity advantages of using quantum machines.

In this paper, we present the parallel algebraic computation of special invariants called symplectic and focus on one particular invariant that finds recent interest in physics. Our results will export to other invariants. The cost of performing basic computations on the multivariate polynomials evolves during the computation, as the polynomials get larger and/or have increasing numbers of terms. Interestingly, in some cases, they stay small. Traditionally, high-performance software is optimized by running experiments with sample data sets in order to profile and optimize expected behavior of workloads in practice. Since the (communication and computation) costs depend on the changing behavior of the symplectic invariant calculations, the standard optimization approach is insufficient. Thus, it is necessary to implement online performance tuning methods that can track the algorithm's progress and state, evaluate performance data in situ, and control the parallel resources during execution.

In the experiment, a broadband entangled photon pair source was shared by end users via wavelength and space division multiplexing. The wide spectrum of generated entangled photon pairs was divided into 16 combinations of frequency-conjugate channels. Photon pairs in each channel combination supported a fully connected subnet with eight users by a passive beam splitter. Eventually, it showed that an entanglement-based QKD network over 100 users could be supported by one entangled photon pair source in this architecture. It has great potential on applications of local quantum networks with large user number.

(2020),2020,Chip-Based Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Using Integrated Silicon Photonic Systems,Physical Review Applied,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.14.011001,"Measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) employs an untrusted relay to prevent the receiver from side-channel attacks commonly encountered in earlier QKD protocols. Conventional MDI QKD systems rely entirely on bulky and expensive optical setups that present great challenges for system scaling and integration. In this work, an all-chip-based MDI QKD system including two transmitter chips and one server chip is demonstrated using integrated silicon photonic technology. The system is capable of generating polarization-encoded weak coherent states with polarization extinction ratios of over 20 dB, sufficient for low-error MDI QKD. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the chip-based MDI QKD system generates a key rate per pulse of 2.923ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€10-6 over a distance corresponding to a 50-km standard fiber with 25% detection efficiency and a predicted distance of 120 km with 85% detection efficiency. Our proof-of-concept prototype makes a giant step forward towards fully chip-based MDI QKD systems and highly integrated quantum communication networks in the near future with its high scalability and cost effectiveness.

Between autonomous underwater vehicle and underwater nodes, it employs symmetric cryptography without causing much encryption and decryption overhead to relay information and correct received information with low-complex on current technique level.

As important as they are likely to be, their implications are still little known. This article's purpose is an attempt to provide a policy space within which to begin fill that void. It presents a non-technical introduction to the concept of quantum mechanics in general, to the unique characteristics of sub-atomic particles, to quantum applications, and to QC and QAI in particular. The development of fully functioning quantum information technologies is in its early stages, but is being pursued aggressively. One of the most salient of these is Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a fusion of QC and AI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which some see as potentially threatening. There is little in established telecommunications or information policies to inform our approach to its capabilities. The article notes some of the challenges to development of quantum-based information technologies and considers the scope of global competition to the U.S. in this field, especially from China. It reviews the treatment of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œQuantum Information ScienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â in U.S. policy. It describes the current policy environment and the range of new measures which might be available, if needed, to incorporate QAI into an overall information policy regime. In conclusion the article reviews the debate over adoption of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprecautionary principleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â for QAI, an approach to policy when it must deal with weakly understood causes of potentially catastrophic or irreversible events. It sets out the arguments pro and con, and in the absence of an immediate resolution proposes adoption of a policy space in which stakeholders can address their salient concerns, without materially impairing technological progress and commercial viability.

We consider scenarios that may include passive sensor arrays, coordinated underwater vehicles, and surface and aerial assets. This analysis suggests that single-photon QKD can potentially be used effectively at depths between 60 and 110 m in clear waters, with the precise depth depending in part on ambient illumination levels.

390,3,C1,Canteaut et al. (2020),2020,Saturnin: A suite of lightweight symmetric algorithms for post-quantum security,IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology,10.13154/tosc.v2020.iS1.160-207,"The cryptographic algorithms needed to ensure the security of our communications have a cost. For devices with little computing power, whose number is expected to grow significantly with the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT), this cost can be a problem. A simple answer to this problem is a compromise on the security level: through a weaker round function or a smaller number of rounds, the security level can be decreased in order to cheapen the implementation of the cipher. At the same time, quantum computers are expected to disrupt the state of the art in cryptography in the near future. For public-key cryptography, the NIST has organized a dedicated process to standardize new algorithms. The impact of quantum computing is harder to assess in the symmetric case but its study is an active research area. In this paper, we specify a new block cipher, Saturnin, and its usage in different modes to provide hashing and authenticated encryption in such a way that we can rigorously argue its security in the post-quantum setting. Its security analysis follows naturally from that of the AES, while our use of components that are easily implemented in a bitsliced fashion ensures a low cost for our primitives. Our aim is to provide a new lightweight suite of algorithms that performs well on small devices, in particular micro-controllers, while providing a high security level even in the presence of quantum computers. Saturnin is a 256-bit block cipher with a 256-bit key and an additional 9-bit parameter for domain separation. Using it, we built two authenticated ciphers and a hash function. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Saturnin-CTR-Cascade is an authenticated cipher using the counter mode and a separate MAC. It requires two passes over the data but its implementation does not require the inverse block cipher. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Saturnin-Short is an authenticated cipher intended for messages with a length strictly smaller than 128 bits which uses only one call to Saturnin to provide confidentiality and integrity. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Saturnin-Hash is a 256-bit hash function. In this paper, we specify this suite of algorithms and argue about their security in both the classical and the post-quantum setting.

While photonic integration of optical components has greatly reduced the overall cost of QKD systems, single-photon detectors (SPDs) have become the most expensive part of a practical QKD system. In order to circumvent this obstacle and make full use of SPDs, we have designed and fabricated a QKD receiver chip for multiple users. Our chip is based on a time-division multiplexing technique and makes use of a single set of SPDs to support up to four users' QKD. Our proof-of-principle chip-based QKD system is capable of producing an average secret key rate of 13.68 kbps for four users with a quantum bit error rate (QBER) as low as 0.51% over a simulated distance of 20 km in fiber. Our result clearly demonstrates the feasibility of multiplexing SPDs for setting QKD channels with different users using photonic integrated chip and may find applications in the commercialization of quantum communication technology.

As a result, traditional neural networks always show poor prediction accuracy in the performance degradation trend prediction of rotating machinery (RM). In view of this, a novel neural network called quantum recurrent encoderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“decoder neural network (QREDNN) is proposed in this paper. In QREDNN, the attention mechanism is used to simultaneously reconstruct encoder and decoder of QREDNN, so that QREDNN can fully excavate and pay attention to important information but suppress the interference of redundant information to obtain better nonlinear approximation capacity. On the other hand, the quantum neuron is used to construct a new quantum gated recurrent unit (QGRU) in which activation values and weights are represented by quantum rotation matrices. The QGRU can traverse the solution space more finely and has a lot of multiple attractors, so it can replace the traditional recurrent unit of the encoder and decoder and enhance the generalization ability and response speed of QREDNN. Moreover, the LevenbergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marquardt (LM) algorithm is introduced to improve the update speeds of the rotation angles of quantum rotation matrices and the attention parameters of QREDNN. Based on the superiorities of QREDNN, a new performance trend prediction method for RM is proposed, in which the denoised fuzzy entropy (DFE) of vibration acceleration signal of RM is input into QREDNN as the performance degradation feature for predicting the performance degradation trend of RM. The examples of predicting the performance trend of rolling bearings demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

(2020),2020,Distributed subkey-relay-tree-based secure multicast scheme in quantum data center networks,Optical Engineering,10.1117/1.OE.59.6.065102,"In data center networks (DCNs), secure multicast provisioning services are obtained from data centers and transported to multiple users in a multicast style, which requires a high demand for security. Moreover, these services are usually stored and maintained in multiple geographically dispersed data centers for more reliable and efficient access. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a state-of-the-art technology employed to unconditionally distribute security keys, based on the principles of quantum physics. Therefore, one should pay more attention to how to efficiently distribute global quantum keys in quantum DCNs in the near future. We investigate the problem of global QKD while leveraging multicast service backups among multiple geographically distributed datacenters for secure service provisioning. A distributed subkey-relay-tree-based, secure multicast scheme is proposed and used as a basis to develop a distributed subkey-relay-tree-based secure multicast-routing and key assignment algorithm. Numerical results show that the latter can achieve higher security probability and lower consumed keys compared with the traditional routing and key assignment scheme and single-key-relay-tree-based secure multicast scheme.

In this general model, a jammer has side information about the channel input. We determine a single letter formula for the correlation assisted capacity. As an application of our main result, we determine the correlation assisted common randomness generation capacity. In this scenario, the two channel users have access to correlation as a resource and further use an AVCQC with an informed jammer for additional discussion. The goal is to create common randomness between the two channel users. We also analyze these capacity formulas when only a small number of signals from the correlation are available. For the correlation assisted common randomness generation capacity, we show an additional interesting property: For a sufficient amount of ""public communication,""common randomness generation capacity is Turing computable; however, without this public communication constraint, the correlation assisted common randomness generation capacity is, in general, not Turing computable. Furthermore, we show that even without knowing the capacity formula of the deterministic capacity using the maximal error criterion, we can show that it is impossible to evaluate the performance algorithmically on any current or future digital computer.

(2020),2020,High-speed and secure PRNG for cryptographic applications,International Journal of Computer Network and Information Security,10.5815/ijcnis.2020.03.01,"Due to the fundamentally different approach underlying quantum cryptography (QC), it has not only become competitive, but also has significant advantages over traditional cryptography methods. Such significant advantage as theoretical and informational stability is achieved through the use of unique quantum particles and the inviolability of quantum physics postulates, in addition it does not depend on the intruder computational capabilities. However, even with such impressive reliability results, QC methods have some disadvantages. For instance, such promising trend as quantum secure direct communication ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ eliminates the problem of key distribution, since it allows to transmit information by open channel without encrypting it. However, in these protocols, each bit is confidential and should not be compromised, therefore, the requirements for protocol stability are increasing and additional security methods are needed. For a whole class of methods to ensure qutrit QC protocols stability, reliable trit generation method is required. In this paper authors have developed and studied trit generation method and software tool TriGen v.2.0 PRNG. Developed PRNG is important for various practical cryptographic applications (for example, trit QC systems, IoT and Blockchain technologies). Future research can be related with developing fully functional version of testing technique and software tool.

One of the most essential tasks for the future development of quantum technologies is the verification of nonclassical resources. Here, we present an artificial neural-network approach for the identification of nonclassical states of light based on recorded measurement statistics. In particular, we implement and train a network which is capable of recognizing nonclassical states based on the click statistics recorded with multiplexed detectors. We use simulated data for training and testing the network, and we show that it is capable of identifying some nonclassical states even if they were not used in the training phase. Especially, in the case of small sample sizes, our approach can be more sensitive in identifying nonclassicality than established criteria, which suggests possible applications in presorting of experimental data and online applications.

(2020),2020,Architecting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Trapped Ion Quantum Computers,Proceedings - International Symposium on Computer Architecture,10.1109/ISCA45697.2020.00051,"Trapped ions (TI) are a leading candidate for building Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including high qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubit TI devices, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD-based TI systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive application-driven architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. To enable our study, we built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions. With industry and academic efforts underway to build TI devices with 50-100 qubits, our insights have the potential to influence QC hardware in the near-future and accelerate the progress towards practical QC systems.

Ring learning with error (RLWE) lattice-based cryptography (LBC) is one of the most promising families of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes in terms of efficiency and versatility. Two conventional methods to compute polynomial multiplication, the most compute-intensive routine in the RLWE schemes, are convolutions and Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).In this work, we explore the energy efficiency of polynomial multiplier using systolic architecture for the first time. As an early exploration, we design two high-throughput systolic array polynomial multipliers, including NTT-based and convolution-based, and compare them to our low-cost sequential (non-systolic) NTT-based multiplier. Our sequential NTT-based multiplier achieves 3x speedup over the state-of-the-art FGPA implementation of the polynomial multiplier in the NewHope-Simple key exchange mechanism on a low-cost Artix7 FPGA. When synthesized on a Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA, the NTT-based systolic and convolution-based systolic designs achieve on average 1.7x and 7.5x speedup over our sequential NTT-based multiplier respectively, which can lead to generating over 2x more signatures per second by CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a PQC digital signature scheme. These explorations help designers select the right PQC implementations for making future signal processing applications quantum-resistant.

Lattice based cryptography is a new post quantum cryptography which has been proved the security under the quantum computer attack. However, due to the limitation of communication frequency and power consumption, it is difficult to implement the lattice based cryptographic algorithm on the existing general processor platform. The polynomial multiplication is the most basic and critical operation in these lattice based cryptographic systems. It is also the computationally intensive operation which is more suitable for hardware implement. In this paper, we proposed a small area, low-power polynomial multiplier design in a specific field. Our scheme not only ensures the performance requirements, but also reduces the overhead of area and power consumption.

(2020),2020,Boosting Monte Carlo simulations of spin glasses using autoregressive neural networks,Physical Review E,10.1103/PhysRevE.101.053312,"The autoregressive neural networks are emerging as a powerful computational tool to solve relevant problems in classical and quantum mechanics. One of their appealing functionalities is that, after they have learned a probability distribution from a dataset, they allow exact and efficient sampling of typical system configurations. Here we employ a neural autoregressive distribution estimator (NADE) to boost Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of a paradigmatic classical model of spin-glass theory, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian. We show that a NADE can be trained to accurately mimic the Boltzmann distribution using unsupervised learning from system configurations generated using standard MCMC algorithms. The trained NADE is then employed as smart proposal distribution for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This allows us to perform efficient MCMC simulations, which provide unbiased results even if the expectation value corresponding to the probability distribution learned by the NADE is not exact. Notably, we implement a sequential tempering procedure, whereby a NADE trained at a higher temperature is iteratively employed as proposal distribution in a MCMC simulation run at a slightly lower temperature. This allows one to efficiently simulate the spin-glass model even in the low-temperature regime, avoiding the divergent correlation times that plague MCMC simulations driven by local-update algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the NADE-driven simulations quickly sample ground-state configurations, paving the way to their future utilization to tackle binary optimization problems.

To prevent steganography from being misused, the scheme of detection of least significant bit steganography in quantum images based on novel enhanced quantum representation of digital images is proposed. In this scheme, the quantum image is partitioning in pixel blocks at first. Then, according to how the value of the discrimination function f changes under the flipping function F, the pixel block can be divided into three types of groups that are regular group, singular group and unusable group, respectively. The number of regular and singular groups is used to determine whether the image is embedded with secret message and calculate the length (in percent of pixels) of secret message. A series of reversible logic circuits are designed to implement the scheme with the circuit complexity of O (q2) , where q is the number of qubits to represent gray scale. Finally, simulation-based experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the detection of secret message in quantum gray images.

Compared with the traditional wireless communication, intelligent robots have the advantages of information security, large capacity, high efficiency and high speed if they interact with each other through quantum communication. In this paper, quantum communication and intelligent robot are combined, and a kind of quantum self-organizing network for robot soccer is proposed. In this network, each robot is both the sender and receiver of quantum information, and all players are communication nodes in the quantum self-organizing network. With the support of certain routing protocols, the network can collect, judge and make decisions on soccer position information, player movement information and soccer goal information. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional wireless method, this scheme not only has higher information security, but also ensures the effectiveness of information transmission. Therefore, this study provides a new idea for the design and development of communication network between soccer robots in the future.

In this article, we combine quantum computing with a classical neural network to design a quantum Hopfield network. Each neuron is initialized to a specified state and evolved into a steady state. The output result is one of patterns in a training set. We also present an application of this protocol in image recognition.

The model utilizes a uniformly connected nodal structure, where the connections are discretely adaptive and the nodes act as simple gatekeepers. The model replicates all known logics used in current electronics, such as AND, OR, XNOR, XOR, NOR, XNOR, NAND and NOT. Additionally, by using recurrent negating connections the model easily creates XOR gates, and adds novel sided and favoured gates. This model also facilitates the creation of ternary to n-ary gates, and it simplifies the creation of a number of majority functions (especially for an odd number of inputs). Also, as a multi-layered neural network, the model allows learning back propagation through the use of its negating connections. Finally, because of its adaptive connections, parts of the network can be used as internal memory. Overall, the model provides backward compatibility to existing CMOS circuitry, while opening up a number of new logics and architectures for neural computing.

This task requires the design of new secret coding schemes, which can be also based on multiple-valued logic (MVL). However, this very specific logic model reveals new possibilities for the hierarchical data clustering of arbitrary data sets. The minimization of multiple-valued logic functions is proposed for the analysis of aggregated objects, which is possible for an arbitrary number of variables. In order to use all the useful properties of the multiple-valued logic, the heterogeneous network architecture is proposed, which includes three allocated levels of artificial intelligence (AI) logic modeling for discrete multiple-valued logic, Boolean logic, and fuzzy logic. Multiple-valued logic is regarded as the possible platform for additional secret coding, data aggregation, and communications, which are provided by the united high dimensional space for network addressing and the targeted control of robotic devices. Models of Boolean and fuzzy logic are regarded as separate logic levels in order to simplify the integration of various algorithms and provide control of additional data protection means for robotic agents.

Most of the current key-distribution mechanisms assume the use of the Internet and WAN networks, which are exposed to security hazards. To overcome them, the use of comprehensive and robust cryptographic mechanisms such as DiffieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hellman (DH) and RSA (RivestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShamirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Adleman) algorithms are proposed. These solutions are limited. DH and RSA have been under threat since the introduction of quantum computing. Hence, new ideas are required. This paper introduces a new security approach for a safe key transmission using undetected high-speed optical camera communication (OCC), which is based on the rolling shutter effect of modern smart cameras. The key transfer is done by blinking light-emitting diode (LED) lights in a specific sequence and frequency, following an encoding pattern. The receiver decodes the received blinks to a bit string using a corresponding image processing application. This optical media ensures secure transfer without the ability to quote it. We demonstrate in an experiment the feasibility of using basic wireless optical communication for key transmission, eliminating the need for a permanent, long, and costly setup. It is mobile, available everywhere anytime, and requires only simple connections to operate. The results show that this method is feasible, robust, efficient, and implementable.

To improve the security performance of communication between control layer and forwarding layer in the software defined network (SDN), we propose a security scheme based on quantum encryption technology. The proposed scheme can realize two-way authentication and quantum key distribution between the controller and the switch. The security performance analysis shows that this scheme can effectively prevent eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks. It effectively improves the southbound security of SDN and provides a theoretical basis for the healthy development of SDN.

Nowadays, QKD integrated in backbone, metro, and access areas has been respectively studied and tested around the world. Although the experiments in various scenarios can verify the feasibility of QKD, the situation of QKD between two end users from metro to access networks has not been considered up to now. In this paper, we propose a QKD Network (QKDN) architecture for end-to-end QKD from metro to access networks in a costefficient manner. The cost efficiency can be achieved by sharing Quantum Receivers (Qrecs) in the metro network with the Quantum Transmitters (Qtras) in various access networks since the distance between any two end users within a metro network permits to distribute quantum keys. Under such an architecture, an end-to-end QKD scheme is designed to provide secret keys for end users in different access networks, by mapping Qrecs and allocating time slots according to security requests. Through the end-to-end QKD scheme, the occupation of Qrecs and time slots can be appropriately improved. To verify the effectiveness of the scheme, simulation is conducted on two different topologies respectively. Performances are evaluated in terms of three parameters: i) the failure ratio of end-to-end QKD (FQ), ii) the utilization ratio of time slots (TU), and iii) the utilization ratio of Qrecs (QU). Simulation results show that the topology with more nodes will lower the QU by distributing requests to more numbers of Qrecs. Moreover, the topology with bigger node connectivity can lower FQ since a shorter path will be selected to save the unnecessary occupation of link resources for other end-to-end requests.

In the practical application of hyperentanglement, the key step is to know the information of the hyperentanglement. In this paper, we propose an efficient protocol to measure the concurrence of arbitrary two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled state, which simultaneously entangles in the polarization and double longitudinal momentum DOFs. This protocol requires the weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity and some linear optical elements to construct the quantum nondemolition detection gate. The concurrence in each DOF can be converted into the success probability of distilling some specified states. Our protocol may play an important role in future quantum information processing.

As the era of Moore's law draws to a close, many new non-von Neumann processors are emerging as potential computational accelerators, including those based on the principles of neuromorphic computing, tensor algebra, and quantum information. While development of these new processors is continuing to mature, the potential impact on accelerated computing is anticipated to be profound. We discuss how different processing models can advance computing in key scientific paradigms: machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Significantly, each of these new processor types utilizes a fundamentally different model of computation, and this raises questions about how to best use such processors in the design and implementation of applications. While many processors are being developed with a specific domain target, the ubiquity of spin-glass models and neural networks provides an avenue for multi-functional applications.

Due to the insulator-to-metal transition of VO2, the amplitude of EIT peak can be actively modulated with significant modulation depth. Meanwhile the group delay within the transparent window can also be dynamically tuned, bringing the active control of slow light effect. Furthermore, we also introduce independently tunable transparent peaks based on double-peak EIT, and the group delay within each transparent window can also be independently controlled. Finally, based on broadband EIT, the active tuning toward quality factor of EIT is also realized. This work introduces active EIT control with multiple degree of freedom by employing VO2, and can find potential applications in future wireless THz communication systems as multi-channel filters, switches, spacers, logic gates and modulators.

The distance that quantum communication schemes can cover via direct communication is fundamentally limited by losses on the communication channel. By means of quantum repeaters, the reach of these schemes can be extended and chains of quantum repeaters could in principle cover arbitrarily long distances. In this work, we provide two efficient algorithms for determining the generation time and fidelity of the first generated entangled pair between the end nodes of a quantum repeater chain. The runtime of the algorithms increases polynomially with the number of segments of the chain, which improves upon the exponential runtime of existing algorithms. Our first algorithm is probabilistic and can analyze refined versions of repeater chain protocols which include intermediate entanglement distillation. Our second algorithm computes the waiting time distribution up to a pre-specified truncation time, has faster runtime than the first one and is moreover exact up to machine precision. Using our proof-of-principle implementation, we are able to analyze repeater chains of thousands of segments for some parameter regimes. The algorithms thus serve as useful tools for the analysis of large quantum repeater chain protocols and topologies of the future quantum internet.

Code-mixing is a common phenomenon on social networking sites for exhibiting opinion on a topic. The code-mixed text is the approach of mixing two or more languages. This paper describes the application of the code-mixed index in Indian social media texts and compares the complexity to identify language at the word level using Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory model. The major contribution of the work is to propose a technique for identifying the language of Hindi-English code-mixed data used in three social media platforms namely, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Here, we demonstrate that a special class of quantum LSTM network model is capable of learning and accurately predicting the languages used in social media texts.

(2020),2020,High-Rate Secure Key Distribution Based on Private Chaos Synchronization and Alternating Step Algorithms,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,10.1142/S0218127420500273,"We propose and numerically demonstrate a high-rate secure key distribution scheme based on private chaos synchronization of two semiconductor lasers subject to common driving injection and an alternating step algorithm (ASA). By exchanging the random control parameters that correspond to different feedback delays of local external-cavity semiconductor lasers, the legitimate users Alice and Bob can identify the time slots in which high-quality private chaos synchronization is achieved. Based on this property, a true random seed key can be independently and privately generated by Alice and Bob, in virtue of symmetric post-processing. Moreover, an ASA is designed to generate a new high-rate key as the final key. By the ASA iterations, random final key distribution with an extended rate significantly higher than that of the seed key can be achieved. The feasibility and performance of the proposed high-rate secure key distribution scheme are verified by numerical simulations. This work provides a high-level security and high-rate random key distribution scheme that has the potential to implement one-time-pad encryption in high-speed secure optical communications.

Although they showcase the great achievements of QKD, many practical difficulties still need to be resolved. Inspired by the significant similarity between mobile ad-hoc networks and QKD technology, we propose a novel quality of service (QoS) model including new metrics for determining the states of public and quantum channels as well as a comprehensive metric of the QKD link. We also propose a novel routing protocol to achieve high-level scalability and minimize consumption of cryptographic keys. Given the limited mobility of nodes in QKD networks, our routing protocol uses the geographical distance and calculated link states to determine the optimal route. It also benefits from a caching mechanism and detection of returning loops to provide effective forwarding while minimizing key consumption and achieving the desired utilization of network links. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed solutions.

Specifically, a comprehensive quantum algorithm for encoding the estimated signal into a quantum state is presented, synthesizing the subroutines of state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, phase estimation and so on. Indispensable assumptions along with the quantum algorithm are summarized and assumption testing in a MIMO scenario is conducted. Both theoretical analyses from the mathematical point of view and simulated realizations in massive MIMO systems basically confirm the applicability of the quantum algorithm. With desired precision, the quantum algorithm achieves almost quadratic speedup over all classical counterparts. Whereas, with weaker precision accompanied by undetermined performance loss, the quantum algorithm eventually breaks through polynomial-time detection complexity and achieves exponential speedup. Future work will be directed toward the error dependence improvement, classical form outputs and experimental applications in quantum communication systems.

However, the bottle-neck problems encountered by quantum key distribution network, such as concurrent conflict of large-scale quantum relay links, relay delay and inconvenient access to applications, are still not solved completely. In order to solve these problems, a quantum relay blockchain scheme is proposed in this paper. In the scheme, each relay node in a target network negotiates a quantum key with everyone of its adjacent nodes respectively, and calculates the XOR values of any two quantum keys from these quantum keys, then encapsulates these XOR values into a transaction. A server encapsulates all the current transactions into a block based on which real-time quantum key services can be realized. Furthermore, the scheme can be easily employed to realize quantum key service in cloud platforms with unconditional security and high efficiency. The scheme, which can be used to overcome the bottle-neck of quantum key distribution network, will play a critical role in future world-wide quantum key service. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2020 ACM.

427,3,C1,Ravi et al. (2020),2020,Authentication protocol for secure automotive systems: Benchmarking post-quantum cryptography,Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,,"Ensuring communication security in real-time automotive networks is of paramount importance given the sensitivity of the exchanged information and highly safety critical nature of its operation. The first step towards ensuring security is to securely authenticate all the computational nodes through use of authentication protocols based on public-key cryptography. But, traditional public-key cryptographic primitives we use today are believed to be breakable by large scale quantum computers of the future. Thus, NIST is currently running a global global level standardization process for quantum-resistant public-key cryptography, better known as post-quantum cryptography. In this work, we perform a first of its kind practical implementation of a secure authentication protocol for automotive systems with post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and perform a detailed comparative evaluation of the speed and communication bandwidth performance against their pre-quantum counterparts.

Its GRCS and endogenous security mechanism can provide Integrated Point-Surface (IPS) suppression without relying on prior knowledge of the attacker and conventional active/passive protection and control measures against uncertain threats based on unknown vulnerabilities or virus Trojans within the target system. Physical or virtual software/hardware bodies or virtual physical combined bodies designed based on this control structure and camouflage mechanism, such as IP cores, chips, middleware/embedded hardware and software, modules, components, devices, systems, platforms or networks, as well as all kinds of virtualization processing scenarios, can effectively control general uncertain disturbances (GUD), including known unknown security risks or unknown unknown security threats. However, CMD aims to solve the deal with uncertain threats from target-unknown vulnerabilities and cannot and will never completely solve all security-related problems in cyberspace, nor does it attempt to independently support the entire protection and control system for cyber security or hinder the inheritance or adoption of the relevant technological achievements and emerging technologies in future. As the world faces a conundrum of unsecured credibility of supply chains at the component layer, CMD only seeks to solve it in the uncertain operational scenarios taking shape on the basis of an innovative GRCS and a mimic camouflage mechanism (MCM),at the software/hardware structural level, and against the background of fully open ecology characterized by national division of labor, industrial division of labor, or even intro-product division of labor; also, it tends to change the current ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcyber game rulesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â by turning over the cyber-attack theories and methods based on software/hardware code design vulnerabilities; promote major innovations in cyber defense theories, game rival models, and technical means and methods; reverse the strategic pattern of seriously imbalanced attack-defense postures; reshape the new cyber security order in the information age; and develop a new generation of information technology and industry featuring endogenous security functionality. In this way, we can eradicate the Achilles heel by addressing the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œoverflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â of product vulnerabilities and other dark features polluting the cyber ecosystem as a result of uncontrollable security or quality factors in the design or manufacturing process of hardware/software products.

As mathematical challenges increase and data become the epicenter of modern decision making, substantial progress needs to be made to draw on emerging analytics and computing technologies. Quantum computing is a ground-breaking technology in information processing that can support the global efforts in addressing power system challenges and in further envisioning the grid of the future. However, despite extensive research activities in quantum computing applications in various sectors, its application to power systems has remained mostly unexamined. It is necessary to have an across-the-board view of the quantum computing technology applications in power systems, and in particular, in building the grid of the future. This paper discusses the essential elements of quantum computing and presents a review of issues concerning this technology.

Limitations of conventional RF, microwave, and millimeter-wave electronic techniques for THz signal generation have been discussed first, followed by signal generation with optical means and accelerator-based techniques have been given. The optical means use optical heterodyning of laser sources, quantum cascade laser, and other methods based on photoconductive material or electro-optic and other nonlinear crystals irradiated with femtosecond laser. In accelerator-based technique, free-electron laser system has been covered for both high-power and portable systems. THz signal detection/sensing based on both electrical and optical techniques and image reconstruction technique has also been discussed. Both quasioptical and waveguide-based approaches are used at THz frequency to realize THz system components like couplers, resonators, polarizers, filters, antennae, etc., and that has been briefly covered. During the last 2decades, THz technology is in use for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) or T-ray imaging and various techniques for this have been discussed. Application of THz technology for security purposes like concealed weapon detection, standoff detection of explosives, and illegal drugs has been addressed, including the use of THz technology by pharmaceutical industry and early diagnosis of cancer by medical fraternity. Possibility of the use of THz technology for the future 6G mobile communications with Tbps (terabit per second) data rate and other advanced communication applications has also been briefly discussed.

But, it is easy to fall into local optimum and is sensitive to the initial choice of cluster centers. As a remedy, a popular trend is to integrate the swarm intelligence algorithm with K-means to obtain hybrid swarm intelligence K-means algorithms. Such as, K-means is combined with particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain particle swarm optimization K-means, and is also combined with genetic mechanism to obtain Genetic K-means algorithms. The classical K-means clustering algorithm requires the number of cluster centers in advance. In this paper, an automatic quantum genetic K-means algorithm for unknown K (AQGUK) is proposed to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the global convergence of AGUK. In AQGUK, a Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1 hyperspace using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as the genetic operations (selection, crossover and mutation) of Q-bits. The length of Q-bit individuals is variable during the evolution, which is Different from the typical genetic algorithms. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, AQGUK can obtain the optimal number of clusters and provide the optimal cluster centroids. Five gene datasets are used to validate AQGUK, AGUK and K-means. The experimental results show that AQGUK is effective and promising.

In this work, a fiber-based 16-channel multiplexer with different time delays was designed based on a construction scheme of 1 (1*4) coupler = 4 (1*4) couplers = 16*optical fibers - 4 (4*1) couplers - 1 (4*1) coupler. The lengths (di, i =1, 2,.16) of the optical fibers were manufactured to be 0 m, 8.0 m,. 120.0 m, respectively, with a length difference (ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Âd) of 8 m. The time delay between the optical fibers (ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Ât) can then be calculated to be 38.8ns. A pulsed 850 nm laser with a repetition rate of 1 MHz and a pulse duration of 10 ns was adopted to test the time-multiplexing capability of the 16-channel fiber coupler. A 1-GHz Si photodetector and a 1-GHz oscilloscope were used to measure the overall insertion loss and relative power through the 16 different channels. The photoelectric pulse count of the pulsed light passing through the fiber bundle will be measured. According to the loss of optical fiber and the photon detection efficiency of detector, we can roughly the photon detection efficiency of the system. If the fiber bundle with 16 entrances instead of only one, the scheme would be used as a detector array, and for imaging. This is what we're going to do in the future.

It is very much essential to bring down the energy use of every device deployed in the IoT network without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) for intelligent transportation system. To achieve this objective, a multiobjective optimisation problem to accomplish the aim of estimating the outage performance of clustering process and the network lifetime is devised. Subsequently, a Hybrid Energy Efficient and QoS Aware (HEEQA) algorithm that is a combination of Quantum Particle Swarm Optimisation (QPSO) along with improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) to achieve energy balance among the devices is proposed. NSGA is applied to solve the problem of multiobjective optimisation and the QPSO algorithm is used to find the optima cooperative nodes and cluster head in the clusters.

Quantum cryptography can provide true randomness and secure distribution of keys, but is prevented from wide applications due to challenges in real implementation.

Quantum random number generators, quantum key distribution, post-quantum and classical cryptography algorithms are integrated in the hybrid quantum-safe scheme to enhance data transfer security in Alibaba platform. Compared with quantum cryptography and post quantum cryptography solutions, the proposed triple-level security cryptographic scheme provides a layered cryptographic solution for different applications, and is compatible with existing solutions.

Namely, the parties seeking to achieve some cryptographic task, often start by establishing a common high-entropy secret that will eventually be used to secure their communication. In this paper, we put forward a security model for group key establishment (GAKE) with an adversary that may execute efficient quantum algorithms, yet only once the execution of the protocol has concluded. This captures a situation in which keys are to be established in the present, while security guarantees must still be provided in the future when quantum resources may be accessible to a potential adversary. Further, we propose a protocol design that can be proven secure in this model. Our proposal uses password authentication and builds upon efficient and reasonably well understood primitives: a message authentication code and a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism. The hybrid structure dodges potential efficiency downsides, like large signatures, of some 'true' post-quantum authentication techniques, making our protocol a potentially interesting fit for current applications with long-term security needs.

(2020),2020,High data-rate optical communication payload for CubeSats,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2567035,"Space industry has undergone a significant change over the last years. The development moved from large and costly spacecrafts to cost-efficient designs and shorter development times. While the satellites became smaller, the resolution of high compact sensors increased which led to a high data-volume to be transmitted and increasing demands for higher data rates on small satellites. This motivated for a highly compact version of DLRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s optical communication payload OSIRIS for small LEO satellites. DLRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Institute of Communications and Navigation has developed the OSIRIS (Optical Space Infrared Downlink System) program starting with payloads on the satellites Flying Laptop of Univ. of Stuttgart and BiROS of DLR. Combining miniaturization to the flight-proven developments with novel concepts, OSIRIS4CubeSat allows integration in a standard CubeSat bus. The development of OSIRIS4CubeSat (industrialized under the product name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCubeLCTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â) is conducted in close collaboration with Tesat Spacecom, DLRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commercialization partner. The first implementation will be demonstrated within the PIXL-1-Mission on a 3Unit CubeSat. Furthermore, OSIRIS4CubeSat (O4C) has been chosen to support scientific missions together with university partners in the field of Quantum Key Distribution (QUBE). In the future, the modular design will enable extensions for optical inter-satellite links. This paper will give an overview about the development of the O4C payload and the current status of the PIXL-1-Mission. Furthermore, it will show the adaptation of the payload for the scientific mission QUBE. Besides these projects, the paper will give an outlook for future extensions of the O4C payload and the necessity of high data-rates in other scenarios such as inter-satellite links.

In order to deliver the information securely, we propose a (t, n) threshold quantum visual secret sharing (QVSS) scheme based on Naor et al.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s visual secret sharing (VSS) scheme, which consists of two phases: sharing process and recovering process. In the firs process, the colour information of each pixel from the original secret image is encoded into an n ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ m-qubit superposition state, and then these qubits are distributed as shares to all participants, respectively. During the recovering process, at least t participants cooperate to collect these shares of each pixel together, then perform the corresponding measurements and recovering algorithm to recover the whole secret image. The proposed scheme has the advantage of single-pixel parallel processing that is not available in the existing analogous quantum schemes. In addition, the performance evaluation of the scheme is discussed theoretically, and its experiment implementation with IBM Q is conducted to demonstrate the practical feasibility.

This study sought to apply these core technologies to future validated algorithms that make real estate transactions secure to come up with an encryption algorithm. In addition, the real estate transaction is being paid a large fee by the middlemen, the real estate agent. Furthermore and recently, P2P (peer-to-peer) real estate exchange is used a lot. However, these P2P real estate exchanges also have problems that have not been identified by each other between landlords and tenants. In particular, a research model was established to compare and verify the PBFT (practical Byzantine fault tolerance) algorithm of Hyperledger through the blockchain agreement process. Subsequently, a process for verifying the real estate contract was established. Through VM (virtual machine) research methodology for the verification of blockchain real estate contracts, ElGamal communication was provided to prove quantum cryptography. We also automated lightweight encryption test verification tools and blockchain smart contract VM (virtual machine) models using artificial intelligence. Verification was performed through a reservation server and a monitoring server using a test verification tool for network-based lightweight security IoT (Internet of things) GW (gateway). It presents important ECP (elastic curve program) and elastic curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) models among the main functions of the blockchain smart contract, and it is equipped with quantum-based encryption algorithm.

Transformative solutions are expected to drive the surge for accommodating a rapidly growing number of intelligent devices and services. Major technological breakthroughs to achieve connectivity goals within 6G include: (i) a network operating at the THz band with much wider spectrum resources, (ii) intelligent communication environments that enable a wireless propagation environment with active signal transmission and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence, (iv) large-scale network automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end for dynamic spectrum access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy savings, (vii) the Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and (viii) cell-free massive MIMO communication networks. In this roadmap paper, use cases for these enabling techniques as well as recent advancements on related topics are highlighted, and open problems with possible solutions are discussed, followed by a development timeline outlining the worldwide efforts in the realization of 6G.

Despite the great variety of cryptographic applications blind signatures also found their way in real-world scenarios. Due to the expected progress in cryptanalysis using quantum computers, it remains an important research question to find practical and secure alternatives to current systems based on the hardness of classical security assumptions such as factoring and computing discrete logarithms. In this work we present BLAZE: a new practical blind signature scheme from lattice assumptions. With respect to all relevant efficiency metrics BLAZE is more efficient than all previous blind signature schemes based on assumptions conjectured to withstand quantum computer attacks. For instance, at approximately 128 bits of security signatures are as small as 6.6Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â KB, which represents an improvement factor of 2.7 compared to all previous candidates, and an expansion factor of 2.5 compared to the NIST PQC submission. Our software implementation demonstrates the efficiency of BLAZE to be deployed in practical applications. In particular, generating a blind signature takes just 18Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â ms. The running time of both key generation and verification is in the same order as state-of-the-art ordinary signature schemes.

A short-term traffic flow prediction algorithm of Quantum Genetic Algorithm - Learning Vector Quantization (QGA-LVQ) neural network is proposed to forecast the changes of traffic flow. Different from BP neural network, Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network is of simple structure, easy implementation and better clustering effect. Utilizing the global optimization ability of Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), it is combined with LVQ neural network to overcome some shortcomings of LVQ neural network, including sensitive to initial weights and prone to local minima. In order to test the convergence ability and the timeliness of QGA-LVQ neural network in short-term traffic flow, some contrast experiments are performed. Experimental simulation results show that, QGA-LVQ neural network obtains excellent prediction results in prediction accuracy and convergence speed. Besides, compared with GA-BP neural network and wavelet neural network, QGA-LVQ neural network performs better in short-term traffic flow prediction.

However, the present communication technologies have several security related issues which is required to provide secure end to end connectivity among services. Moreover, due to recent, rapid growth of quantum technologies, most common security mechanisms considered secure today may be soon imperilled. Thus, the modern security mechanisms during their construction also require the power of quantum technologies to resist various potential attacks from quantum computers. Because of its characteristics, quantum walks (QW) is considered as a universal quantum computation paradigm that can be accepted as an excellent key generator. In this regard, in this paper a new lightweight image encryption scheme based on QW for secure data transfer in the internet of things platforms and wireless networking with edge computing is proposed. The introduced approach utilises the power of nonlinear dynamic behaviour of QW to construct permutation boxes and generates pseudo-random numbers for encrypting the plain image after dividing it into blocks. The results of the conducted simulation and numerical analyses confirm that the presented encryption algorithm is effective. The encrypted images have randomness properties, no useful data about the ciphered image can be obtained via analysing the correlation of adjacent pixels. Moreover, the entropy value is close to 8, the number of the pixel change rate is greater than 99.61%, and there is high sensitivity of the key parameters with large key space to resist various attacks.

The amount of static as well as dynamic data requests generated by these real-time applications will be unpredictable and unmanageable shortly causing fronthaul congestion.

In this paper, AI has been engaged in an attempt to enhance the caching capability in F-APs by updating caching content intelligently in quantum regime, accelerating computational speed and facilitating limited storage concerns. To validate our proposed framework, certain simulations are carried out in MATLAB. The results show an inevitable outcomes for F-RANs performance up gradation.

(2020),2020,Efficient lattice CP-ABE AC scheme supporting reduced-OBDD structure for CCN/NDN,Symmetry,10.3390/SYM12010166,"In line with the proposed 5th Generation network, content centric network/named data networking (CCN/NDN) has been offered as one of the promising paradigms to cope with the communication needs of future realistic network communications. CCN/NDN allows network communication based on content names and also allows users to obtain information from any of the nearest intermediary caches on the network. Due to that, the ability of cached content to protect itself is essential since contents can be cached on any node everywhere, and publishers may not have total control over their own published data. The attribute based encryption (ABE) scheme is a preferable approach, identified to enable cached contents to be self-secured since it has a special property of encryption with policies. However, most of the proposed ABE schemes for CCN/NDN suffer from some loopholes. They are not flexible in the expression of access policy, they are inefficient, they are based on bilinear maps with pairings, and they are vulnerable to quantum cryptography algorithms. Hence, we propose the ciphertext policy attribute based encryption access control (CP-ABE AC) scheme from a lightweight ideal lattice based on ring learning with error (R-LWE) problem, and demonstrated its use in practical applications. The proposed scheme is proved to be secure and efficient under the decision ring LWE problem in the selective set model. To achieve an efficient scheme, we used an efficient trapdoor technique and the access tree representation of access structure describing the access policies was modified into a new structure, based on a reduced ordered binary decision diagram (reduce-OBDD). This access structure can support Boolean operations such as AND, NOT, OR, and threshold gates. The final result showed that the proposed scheme was secure and efficient for applications, thereby supporting CCN/NDN as a promising paradigm.

The multi-user network performance can be enhanced via MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) technology to get the maximum secure key rates due to the less insertion loss and crosstalk for switching operation. We have analyzed a four-state, quadrature-phase shift keying (QPSK) transmitter to generate quantum keys, i.e. Alice, while a classical coherent receiver aided by the digital post-processing unit is being used as Bob. To route the secure QKD traffic to the end-users, 1x2, 1x4, 1x8 and 1x12 switching configurations have been analyzed for the transmission distance ranging from 0 to 60 km. We have achieved the secure key rates of 30 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s for the 1x12 and 1x2 switching configurations, respectively. We have also compared the performance of routed QKD traffic with a simple point-to-point QKD system and the classical DV-QKD protocol. The QKD networks need an effective low-loss fibre channel and a distribution system to enhance the transmission distance of the secure keys and applications. This paper provides multi-user used case as an important paradigm with the corresponding scheme and simulation performances.

This algorithm establishes the prediction model through the neural network and uses the quantum ant colony algorithm to optimize the output weight. In order to solve the problem that the quantum ant colony algorithm has low convergence precision and easy to fall into the local optimal solution in the inverse solution algorithm of the multifreedom robotic arm, improved measures such as 2-opt local optimization and maximum minimum pheromone limit and variation are adopted. By comparing the simulation results of the 6R robotic arm simulation results and the simulation results based on ACA, QACA, and RBF neural networks on the position and motion trajectory of the space point, the advantages in precision are obvious. This proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.

456,6,C3,Huang et al. (2020),2020,Quantum Key Distribution over Double-Layer Quantum Satellite Networks,IEEE Access,10.1109/aCCESS.2020.2966683,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) has attracted much attention on secure communications across global networks. QKD over satellite networks can overcome the limitations of terrestrial optical networks, such as large attenuation over long distance fiber channel and difficulty of intercontinental domain communications. Different QKD networks (around the world) can intercommunicate through quantum satellites, leading to a global quantum network in near future. This raises a new resource allocation and management problem of QKD involving multiple satellite layers and distributed ground stations. Using existing schemes, a single satellite cannot perform QKD for ground stations for the whole day. Moreover, the research problem is more challenging due to limitations of satellite coverage: limited cover time of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite, high channel losses of geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite, etc. To overcome these limitations, our study proposes a double-layer quantum satellite network (QSN) implemented quantum key pool (QKP) to relay keys for ground stations. We propose a new architecture of trusted-repeater-based double-layer quantum satellite networks, comprising GEO and LEO satellites. We also address the routing and key allocation (RKa) problem for key-relay services over QSNs. We propose a novel joint GEO-LEO routing and key allocation (JGL-RKa) algorithm to solve the RKa problem. Simulative results show that the proposed scheme can increase success probability of key-relay services significantly. We also present the impact of different route selections mechanisms, number of satellite links, satellite node capability, and service granularity on network performance.

Therefore, the research on information transmission in partially entangled channels of quantum network is of academic value and general application. Meanwhile, as multi-participating information transmission modes, broadcast and multicast communications are two important applications in quantum information transmission and quantum computation. In this paper, we propose the quantum broadcast and multicast schemes based on partially entangled states.

(2020),2020,An efficient algorithm for quantum computing with quantum key distribution with secure communication,Journal of Engineering Science and Technology,,"The key formation is a crucial primitive for constructing secure networks: in a multi-party setting, it permits two parties using public authenticated communication to create a secret session key, which used to encrypt messages. QKD is an innovative technology that exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute unconditionally secure shared key for use in cryptographic applications. Currently, many symmetric key cryptographic tools, which are known to be quantum-safe. They all share secret symmetric keys, through untrusted communication, which finished with public-key systems, which are prone to quantum attacks. One of the recommended solutions to the key distribution problem is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). QKD can be used to generate secret keys that are secure against any future algorithmic /computational improvements. QKD utilizes an authenticated communication channel along with a quantum communication channel so that a secret key generated. Whatever may be the protocol to implement proposed QKD, they all need both a quantum channel and an authenticated classical. OTP (One Time Pad) is a randomly generated key. Therefore, this key length is equal to the message. The proposed QKD result is 35.67% smaller keys for quantum security. The performance of a QKD system against a modeled photon number splitting attack analysed in simulation results and standard key agreement protocols can be secure.

In this manuscript, we propose an alternative to minor embedding, developing a new approximate procedure based on genetic algorithms, allowing to decouple the p-body in terms of 2-body interactions. A set of preliminary numerical experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach for the ferromagnetic p-spin model and paves the way towards the application of evolutionary strategies to more complex quantum models.

In this paper, we proposed a hybrid chaotic radial basis function neural oscillatory network (HCRBFNON) based foreign exchange (Forex) product price series prediction and quantum price levels based hedging trading system. In our forecasting system, the HCRBFNON consists of three components: 1) Quantum Finance Theory to model the secondary financial market and extract the financial dynamic energy level feature, 2) Long short-term memory mechanism to extract the temporal financial feature, 3) Chaotic type-2 transient-fuzzy membership function based transient chaotic radial basis layer to model the highly chaotic financial time series. In the quantum finance hedging trading system (QFHTS), we employ the forecasting prices from the HCRBFNON and the respective nearest quantum price levels to construct the trading timing capture. In the model evaluation, we measure the performance CRBFNON with 5 popular models used in financial time series prediction; we also compared the trading performance of QFHTS with 2 classical technical analysis-based trading strategies. By using 12 most popular forex product datasets from 2011 to 2019 for the system testing, the experimental results revealed that both the HCRBFNON and QFHTS achieve promising results in terms of forecast and trading performances respectively.

Although the NB-IoT system has gradually been improved in the traditional LTE network currently, the NB-IoT system does not have an effective access authentication scheme in the future 5G network. According to the current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, NB-IoT devices still use the traditional access authentication method to perform mutual authentication with the network, which may bring a large amount of signaling and communication overhead. This problem will be magnified in a large-scale device environment in the future 5G network. In this article, a quantum resistance access authentication and data distribution scheme is proposed for large-scale NB-IoT devices. The scheme can simultaneously implement access authentication and data transmission of a group of NB-IoT devices based on the lattice-based homomorphic encryption technology. Our scheme not only greatly reduce the network burden but also achieve strong security, including privacy protection and anti-quantum attacks. The performance analysis results show that our scheme has the ideal efficiency.

It can be applied to a multi-node network, in which a single photon sequence can be sent to all the slave nodes simultaneously. In broadcast communication networks, these single photons encode classical information directly through noisy quantum communication channels. The results show that this protocol can realize the secret key generation and sharing of multiple nodes. The protocol we propose is also proved to be unconditionally secure in theory, which indicates its feasibility in theoretical application. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019 by the authors.

Network resilience against link disruption is supported by high-QKD link rates and network link redundancy. We reveal that such a metropolitan network can support tens of thousands of users with key rates in excess of 1 kilobit per second (kbps) per user. Our result hence demonstrates a clear path for implementing quantum security in metropolitan fibre networks.

A critical obstacle is that almost all existing security proofs make ideal assumptions on the QKD devices. Problematically, such assumptions are hard to satisfy in the experiments, and therefore it is not obvious how to apply such security proofs to practical QKD systems. Fortunately, any imperfections and security-loopholes in the measurement devices can be perfectly closed by measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), and thus we only need to consider how to secure the source devices. Among imperfections in the source devices, correlations between the sending pulses and modulation fluctuations are one of the principal problems, which unfortunately most of the existing security proofs do not consider. In this paper, we take into account these imperfections and enhance the implementation security of QKD. Specifically, we consider a setting-choice-independent correlation (SCIC) framework in which the sending pulses can present arbitrary correlations but they are independent of the previous setting choices such as the bit, the basis and the intensity settings. Within the framework of SCIC, we consider the dominant fluctuations of the sending states, such as the relative phases and the intensities, and provide a self-contained information-theoretic security proof for the loss-tolerant QKD protocol in the finite-key regime. We demonstrate the feasibility of secure quantum communication, and thus our work constitutes a crucial step towards guaranteeing the security of practical QKD systems.

We perform a proof-of-principle experiment using polarization entangled photon pairs. In the presence of a varying rotational phase, we obtain a consistently low error rate of less than 4%, indicating the feasibility of this protocol for QKD.

However, hardware-based TPM has several intrinsic problems such as extremely low performance, off-chip security vulnerability, and a lack of incident response agility. In the upcoming Quantum computing era, it is critical to provide Quantum-Resistant (QR) cryptography functions without harming performance. Unfortunately, hardware-based TPM's rigid hardware and software architecture model makes it extremely difficult for hardware-based TPM to transition to accommodate future QR cryptographic systems. On the other hand, software-based TPMs (e.g., firmware-based TPM) provide a CPU-based, on-chip security solution. They utilize low-level on-chip primitives offered by chipsets such as ARM TrustZone or Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to build a system with a high-level of trust computing environment. A software-based TPM solution provides higher performance, on-chip security, and incident response agility. However, it is lacking in hardware-backed protection and several vital features such as secure key storage, robustness against side-channel attacks, true random number generation, among others. In addition, its implementation is highly dependent on low-level primitives provided by each hardware vendor, which makes it difficult for it to be provided as a generalized solution. In this paper, we propose hybrid-TPM (hTPM), which fully utilizes the advantages of a hardware-based TPM and diminishes a hardware-based TPM's weaknesses through software-based TPM solutions inside a secure container, e.g., Virtualization-Based Security (VBS). We implemented hTPM as a fully dual mode TPM, i.e., giving end-users full control in choosing between a hardware TPM mode and a software TPM mode based on their needs. We performed and will provide a full risk analysis of the proposed hTPM to show how to best overcome security challenges in realizing hTPM. Finally, we provide a performance analysis of our proposal to show the drastic improvements in cryptographic operations.

Internet of Things (IoT), industry 4.0, smart city and next-generation interconnected vehicles are some examples of scenarios in which a high volume of nodes share data across networks. Hence, the data protection plays a fundamental aspect to avoid disclosure or manipulation of sensitive information and disruption of services, particularly in safety critical applications. On the other hand, also the compute power at disposal of possible attackers and hackers is growing, and next-future post-quantum capabilities will require the usage of longer keys, certificates and digital signatures, to preserve the security level offered by cryptographic functions. This will affect not only the amount of exchange data, but also the computational resources to secure data, increasing processing time, latencies and power consumption, and lowering data rates. In this work, we investigate different implementation strategies to overcome such performance limitations. This work provides a comparison among pure software approach (both on 32b and 64b processors) and hardware-based solutions we developed for FPGA and ASIC System-on-Chip platforms, for the most common symmetric-key and public-key cryptographic algorithms. The proposed hardware accelerators feature one order of magnitude higher throughput (and lower latency) and more than two orders lower power consumption than their software counterparts. A highly configurable cryptographic suite is proposed that can be customized according to the application requirements and thus able to increase as much as possible the efficiency in terms of energy per enciphered bits per second.

In the proposed protocol, keys can be generated using the spatial mode and polarization DOFs simultaneously.

Such techniques are realized, for example, by monitoring for photon loss at the receiving end of the quantum channel while not disturbing the transmitted quantum state. We describe and experimentally benchmark a scheme that incorporates error detection in a direct quantum channel connecting two transmon qubits using traveling microwave photons. This is achieved by encoding the quantum information as a time-bin superposition of a single photon, which simultaneously realizes high communication rates and high fidelities.

TESAT's LCTs have successfully accomplished more than 25.000 links in the past six years. In this paper, an overview of the results generated during this time is presented. Eight LCTs 135, 1064 nm wavelength are/have been in operation in the past six years. Two LCTs are on board of geostationary satellites (GEOs) and six are/were on board of low-orbit satellites (LEOs) covering wide range of missions from earth observation (e.g. Copernicus program) and surveillance to technology demonstrator payloads (e.g. TDP1 Experimentation Program) [1] [2]. Space to ground links (SGLs) have been demonstrated using different art of optical ground stations (OGS). Up- and down-optical links with and without communication between the Technology Demonstrator Payload 1 (TDP1) and the DLR Transportable Adaptive Optics Ground Station (T-AOGS) [12] have been used for experimental purpose, contributing to the data generation for atmospheric modelling and supporting the experts in building a better understanding of atmospheric impact onto the optical channel [3]. In order to implement and operate the LCTs, new operational concepts have been developed. Generation of operational products like link requests or commanding files has been supported and tuned [5] [2]. Further technology applications like airborne terminals are currently under validation. In 2019, several companies have started the verification of their terminals using the E2E test bed TDP1 and the T-AOGS described in [4]. Testing campaigns are ongoing in 2019. The TDP1 test bed has also supported quantum key distribution (QKD) verifications [7] [13] and optical channel characterization [9]. Methods for analysis, characterization and assessment of trends and performances of the LCTs in space and OGS have been developed and implemented. The Long Term Performance Analysis (LTPA) enables the assessment of potential degradations and allows for an introduction of corresponding counter measures (i.e. parameter settings modifications) preventing from negative impact on operations and services [6] [10]. The knowledge gained from the TDP1 Program has been an important contribution to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS).

There is a pressing need to examine the properties attached to a quantum network architecture from multiple perspectives, including physics foundations2, communication security3, the efficient use of resources and innovative technological applications4,5. Here, we present an experimental realization of a five-node quantum network, in which quantum sources at two nodes deliver entangled photon pairs to three measurement nodes. With relevant events between five nodes separated space-like, we demonstrate violation of the Bell inequality and bilocal inequality6, with the locality, measurement independence and quantum source independence loopholes closed simultaneously in a quantum network. This experimental realization may be valuable for the design and implementation of future quantum networks.

A key aspect of this research is devising methods to most effectively utilize emerging quantum computing hardware. Research questions include what experiments on early quantum hardware would give the most insight into the potential impact of quantum computing, the design of algorithms to explore on such hardware, and the development of tools to minimize the quantum resource requirements. We survey work relevant to these questions, with a particular emphasis on our recent work in quantum algorithms and applications, in elucidating mechanisms of quantum mechanics and their uses for quantum computational purposes, and in simulation, compilation, and physics-inspired classical algorithms. To our early application thrusts in planning and scheduling, fault diagnosis, and machine learning, we add thrusts related to robustness of communication networks and the simulation of many-body systems for material science and chemistry.

In the scheme, Alice and David prepare an arbitrary N-qubit state on BobÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s side under the control of Charlie by using a 3N + 1-qubit entangled state as the quantum channel. First, the quantum channel is constructed through the Hadamard and controlled-NOT operations. Then, Alice, David, and Charlie each perform the quantum measurements on their own qubits. To ensure that the original state can be prepared determinately, two algorithms are proposed to construct the measurement bases for Alice and David. Finally, Bob reconstructs the original state with several appropriate unitary operations on his qubits according to the measurement results of Alice, David, and Charlie. To demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme, a remote preparation example of an arbitrary two-qubit state with the scheme is given. At the end of this paper, the efficiency analysis of the scheme and some conclusions is presented. In comparison with previous schemes, the scheme is superior in terms of the capability and efficiency of quantum communication.

Higher-performance systems now remain impractical largely only because their algorithms are extremely computationally demanding. For optimal performance, an amount of computation that increases at an exponential rate both with the number of users and with the data rate of each user is often required. The base station's computational capacity is thus becoming one of the key limiting factors on wireless capacity. QuAMax is the first large MIMO centralized radio access network design to address this issue by leveraging quantum annealing on the problem. We have implemented QuAMax on the 2,031 qubit D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, the state-of-the-art in the field. Our experimental results evaluate that implementation on real and synthetic MIMO channel traces, showing that 10 's of compute time on the 2000Q can enable 48 user, 48 AP antenna BPSK communication at 20 dB SNR with a bit error rate of 10-6 and a 1,500 byte frame error rate of 10-4.

Unfortunately, present classical computers technology and process speed for massive PPI data is far from meeting demand. It is a general trend of researching that utilizing quantum computation methods, bioinformatics knowledge and machine learning ability to effectively investigate existing massive data for discovering and verifying new PPI. In this paper, we utilize the quantum ant colony optimization algorithm (QAC) to optimize the quantum-inspired neural network QNN's parameters and propose a novel quantum neurocomputing scheme QAC-QNN which can prevent the solution sinking into local optimization. The simulation experiments prove that the novel scheme is feasible. For predicting PPI of proteins couple, in contrast with SVM and ANN, QAC-QNN achieves better prediction effects.

Day by day we are increasing the usage of data for transmission and storage as well. But there is always a problem for our data to be in wrong hands or hacked by someone. In order to ensure our secrecy of data we use bunch of algorithms to secure it. These algorithms comes under the vast section of cryptology, which means an art of hiding the data to make it secure. But as we all know when there is a hacker he would find every possible way to bypass the security algorithms. Some of the attacks are very popular in cryptology like Brute Force Attacks which checks each possible key combination to hack the data message. Due to the arrival of quantum computers in upcoming future hacking time will be decreased about a factor of around 1000 times. Now the best possible solution for enciphering data is Advanced Encryption Standard. This algorithm consists of two basic things static Substitution Box (S-Box) and other register operation. In this paper we have introduced a new technique to ensure a secure communication by using a dynamic S-Box with avalanche value of 58.59% as well as we also improved the overall area, delay (1.227 ns) and optimized the power to possible extents. Our results also approached above the traditional AES security as our modification improves avalanche effect also.

This is based on Gaussian modulation with coherent states in the polarization degree of freedom. We achieved a QKD distance at 460 m at a repetition rate of 10 kHz. The secure key rate is 0.152 kbps at the typical reconciliation efficiency of 0.95. The experimental setup of this scheme is simplified, and the barrier for implementation has been remarkably reduced compared to that for traditional symmetric modulation protocols, for example, the GG02 protocol proposed in F. Grosshans and P. Grangier [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 057902 (2002)10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.057902].

However, whether it is a fiber channel or a free-space channel, the channel in which it propagates is affected by noise, resulting in loss or absorption of photons. Experimental studies have shown that the quantum key can basically meet the requirements of the local area network, and the safety distance is about 100km. However, if you want to achieve longer distance distribution, you can't do without quantum repeaters. The quantum repeater can divide the long-distance communication distance into several segments, and then perform quantum key distribution in several segments respectively; then establish a longer-distance EPR pair between adjacent nodes, and establish an EPR pair to utilize entanglement switching and Entanglement purification technology; finally repeat the above steps, and finally achieve long-distance information transmission. The development of quantum repeaters can solve the communication problems facing the world and promote the replacement of global communication methods. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Most of the time, hand-designed networks are responsible for this incredible success. However, this engineering process demands considerable time and expert knowledge, which leads to an increasing interest in automating the design of deep architectures. Several new algorithms have been proposed to address the neural architecture search problem, but many of them require significant computational resources. Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEA) have their roots on quantum computing principles and present promising results in respect to faster convergence. In this work, we propose Q-NAS (Quantum-inspired Neural Architecture Search): a quantum-inspired algorithm to search for deep neural architectures by assembling substructures and optimizing some numerical hyperparameters. We present the first results applying Q-NAS on the CIFAR-10 dataset using only 20 K80 GPUs for about 50 hours. The obtained networks are relatively small (less than 20 layers) compared to other state-of-the-art models and achieve promising accuracies with considerably less computational cost than other NAS algorithms.

Parameterized quantum circuits (P QC) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative (e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a P QC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a P QC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time. In this paper, we present training methodologies for P QC in a completely classical environment that can improve the fidelity of the trained P QC on a target NISQ hardware by as much as 21.91%.

A technology once believed to lie far away in the future is increasingly closer to real-world applications. Quantum computers will break the algorithms used in our public key infrastructure and in our key exchange protocols, forcing a complete retooling of cryptography as we know it. Quantum key distribution is a physical layer technology immune to quantum or classical computational threats. However, it requires a physical substrate, and optical fiber has been the usual choice. Most of the time, it is used just as a point-To-point link for the exclusive transport of delicate quantum signals. Its integration in a realworld shared network has not been attempted so far. Here we show how the new programmable software network architectures, together with specially designed quantum systems, can be used to produce a network that integrates classical and quantum communications, including management, in a single, production-level infrastructure. The network can also incorporate new quantum-safe algorithms and use the existing security protocols, thus bridging the gap between today's network security and the quantum-safe network of the future. This can be done in an evolutionary way, without zero-day migrations and the corresponding upfront costs. We also present how the technologies have been deployed in practice using a production network.

Even though there has been extensive theoretical research toward nanoscale MC, there are no examples of implemented nanoscale MC networks. The main reason for this lies in the peculiarities of nanoscale physics, challenges in nanoscale fabrication, and highly stochastic nature of the biochemical domain of envisioned nanonetwork applications. This mandates developing novel device architectures and communication methods compatible with MC constraints. To that end, various transmitter and receiver designs for MC have been proposed in the literature together with numerable modulation, coding, and detection techniques. However, these works fall into domains of a very wide spectrum of disciplines, including, but not limited to, information and communication theory, quantum physics, materials science, nanofabrication, physiology, and synthetic biology. Therefore, we believe it is imperative for the progress of the field that an organized exposition of cumulative knowledge on the subject matter can be compiled. Thus, to fill this gap, in this comprehensive survey, we review the existing literature on transmitter and receiver architectures toward realizing MC among nanomaterial-based nanomachines and/or biological entities and provide a complete overview of modulation, coding, and detection techniques employed for MC. Moreover, we identify the most significant shortcomings and challenges in all these research areas and propose potential solutions to overcome some of them.

The need to represent numeric quantities using limited resources leads to digitization errors which must be taken into account. As a first step towards quantum simulations of realistic high-energy physics problems, we use ensembles of SU(2) lattice gauge fields generated with standard classical computing to explore the effects of digitizing elements of the gauge group to a finite set. We consider several methods for digitizing the group, finding the best performance from an action-preserving projection onto a mesh. Working in (3+1) dimensions, we find that using ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã‚Â¼7 (qu)bits to represent each SU(2) gauge link induces a digitization error of the order of 10% in short-distance observables and 2% in long-distance observables. Promisingly, our results indicate that each SU(2) gauge link can be represented by O(10) (qu)bits, from which we estimate that a 163SU(2) lattice could be simulated with no more than O(105) (qu)bits. Our results on digitization are also of interest as a form of lossy compression that could be used in high-performance classical computing to alleviate communications bottlenecks.

The keystones of such structures are the reliable generation, transmission, and manipulation of quantum states. Two-dimensional quantum states, qubits, are steadily adopted as information units. However, high-dimensional quantum states, qudits, constitute a richer resource for future quantum networks, exceeding the limitations imposed by the ubiquitous qubits. The generation and manipulation of such D-level systems have been improved over the last ten years, but their reliable transmission between remote locations remains the main challenge. Here, we show how a recent air-core fiber supporting orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes can be exploited to faithfully transmit D-dimensional states. Four OAM quantum states and their superpositions are created, propagated in a 1.2-km-long fiber and detected with high fidelities. In addition, three quantum-key-distribution protocols are implemented as concrete applications to assert the practicality of our results. This experiment enhances the distribution of high-dimensional quantum states, attesting the orbital angular momentum as a vessel for the future quantum network. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019 authors.

Radial basis function network (RBFN) is a type of feedforward network that capable of perform nonlinear approximation on unknown dataset. It has been widely used in classification, pattern recognition, nonlinear control and image processing. Thus, with the increases in RBFN application, some problems and weakness of RBFN network is identified. Through the combination of quantum computing and RBFN provides a new research idea in design and performance improvement of RBFN system. This paper describes the theory and application of quantum computing and cloning operators, and discusses the superiority of these theories and the feasibility of their optimization algorithms.This proposed improved RBFN (I-RBFN) that combined with cloning operator and quantum computing algorithm demonstrated its ability in global search and local optimization to effectively speed up learning and provides better accuracy in prediction results. Both the algorithms that combined with RBFN optimize the centers and spread value of RBFN. The proposed I-RBFN was tested against the standard RBFN in predictions. The experimental models were tested on four literatures nonlinear function and four real-world application problems, particularly in Air pollutant problem, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) problem, Phytoplankton problem, and forex pair EURUSD. The results are compared to I-RBFN for root mean square error (RMSE) values with standard RBFN. The proposed I-RBFN yielded better results with an average improvement percentage more than 90 percent in RMSE. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

(2019),2019,Cost-efficient quantum key distribution (QKD) over WDM networks,Journal of Optical Communications and Networking,10.1364/JOCN.11.000285,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses the laws of quantum mechanics to distribute secret keys with information-theoretic security. To realize QKD for secure communications among multiple distant users, fiber-based QKD networks can be deployed with today's available technologies. Incorporating QKD into existing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) network infrastructure provides a practical way to reduce the difficulty and cost of QKD networking. Nonetheless, the costs of QKD nodes and QKD links are still considered as the major barriers to long-distance QKD network deployment in practice. In this work, we study how to minimize the cost of deploying QKD-over-WDM backbone networks. We introduce a general architecture of QKD-over-WDM backbone networks. A novel cost-oriented model is defined to elaborate the cost-minimized problem, in which various QKD network components including QKD transceivers, QKD auxiliary equipment for QKD backbone nodes and trusted repeater nodes (TRNs), and QKD links are considered. The physical-layer parameters such as secret-key rate, physical distance, and the layout of TRNs are also incorporated in our defined model. We develop an integer linear programming (ILP) model and a novel cost-efficient QKD networking (CEQN) heuristic algorithm to address the cost-minimized problem. The extensive simulations indicate that our proposed approaches are effective in reducing the cost of deploying QKD-over-WDM backbone networks, where the designed CEQN algorithm is efficient to demonstrate similar to the ILP model. Finally, some open issues in future work are discussed, given that this work only presents an early highlevel analysis as opposed to a definitive detailed model.

(2019),2019,Assessing the quantum-resistant cryptographic agility of routing and switching IT network infrastructure in a large-size financial organization,Journal of Information Security and Applications,10.1016/j.jisa.2019.03.007,"This paper provides exploratory research by determining the impact of quantum computing threat on modern routing and switching infrastructure components of IT network infrastructure in a large-size financial organization. We determine whether common routing and switching IT network infrastructure, including its hardware and software components, have enough cryptographic agility to accommodate the change of cryptographic algorithms to the ones that do not exhibit vulnerability to quantum computing and to the ones that are compliant with National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B set of protocols. We pinpoint upstream or downstream impacts of a change in the encryption algorithms across various IT network infrastructure components in terms of effort required to accomplish this transition. This study is among the first studies that investigate quantum-resistance cryptographic from the hardware perspectives of routing and switching technologies using diffusion of innovation theory. The study integrates enterprise governance to meet the challenges presented by quantum-computing with a focus on cryptographic agility. We offer an enterprise architecture framework for assessing the dependencies, costs, and benefits of IT infrastructure migration plan to meet the future challenges of quantum-resistant cryptographic. The analysis in this research can be used by IT managers to pre-plan for an upgrade of routing and switching infrastructure, assist in estimating the efforts required to perform these upgrades, and assist in selecting a vendor of routing and switching equipment from the perspective of cryptographic agility. With today's supercomputers, a computational task involved in breaking modern asymmetric cryptographic algorithms would be infeasible due to the required computational complexity. However, with progress in the development of quantum computing technology, firms are facing an increasing risk of potential security threats to existing encrypted data and secured transmission channels as the processing power of quantum computers continue to increase.

(2019),2019,Lattice-based public key cryptosystem for internet of things environment: Challenges and solutions,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2018.2878707,"Due to its widespread popularity and usage in many applications (smart transport, energy management, e -healthcare, smart ecosystem, and so on), the Internet of Things (IoT) has become popular among end users over the last few years. However, with an exponential increase in the usage of IoT technologies, we have been witnessing an increase in the number of cyber attacks on the IoT environment. An adversary can capture the private key shared between users and devices and can launch various attacks, such as IoT ransomware, Mirai botnet, man-in-the-middle, denial of service, chosen plaintext, and chosen ciphertext. To mitigate these security attacks on the IoT environment, the traditional public key cryptographic primitives are inadequate because of their high computational and communication costs. Therefore, lattice-based public-key cryptosystem (LB-PKC) is a promising technique for secure communication. We discuss the taxonomy of two major problems, namely, the shortest path and the closest path problems with respect to the applicability of lattice-based cryptographic primitives for IoT devices. Moreover, we also discuss various LB-PKC techniques, such as NTRU, learning with errors (LWEs), and ring-LWE (R-LWE) which are often used to solve shortest path and lattice NP-hard problems in a polynomial time. We further classify the R-LWE into three categories, namely identity-based encryption, homomorphic encryption, and secure authentication key exchange. We describe the operations and algorithms adopted in each of these encryption mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the challenges, open issues, and future directions for applying LB-PKC in the IoT environment.

In this paper, over noisy quantum atmospheric turbulence channels, a new non-orthogonal coherent-state massive-MIMO uplink scheme is proposed. At the receiver, a composite quantum iterative multi-stage measuring instrument and MIMO detector is developed. In particular, a non-additive Poisson shot noise limited quantum iterative massive-MIMO interference cancellation algorithm is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable of obtaining the substantial spatial diversity gain in severely noisy quantum turbulence channels, while effectively mitigating the quantum multi-user (MU) interference. Quantitatively, for the 8 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 64 MIMO scenario, it can achieve the BER of 10-6 at -179.3dBJ per bit over a strong Gamma-Gamma turbulence fading channel (ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â±c - 2.1, ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â²c - 2.4).

However, the exponential decay of correlation in MPSs restricts its representation power heavily for modeling complex data such as natural images. In this work, we push forward the effort of applying tensor networks to machine learning by employing the tree tensor network (TTN), which exhibits balanced performance in expressibility and efficient training and sampling. We design the tree tensor network to utilize the two-dimensional prior of the natural images and develop sweeping learning and sampling algorithms which can be efficiently implemented utilizing graphical processing units. We apply our model to random binary patterns and the binary MNIST data sets of handwritten digits. We show that the TTN is superior to MPSs for generative modeling in keeping the correlation of pixels in natural images, as well as giving better log-likelihood scores in standard data sets of handwritten digits. We also compare its performance with state-of-the-art generative models such as variational autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines, and PixelCNN. Finally, we discuss the future development of tensor network states in machine learning problems.

(2019),2019,Loss-tolerant teleportation on large stabilizer states,Quantum Science and Technology,10.1088/2058-9565/aaf6c4,"We present a general method for finding loss-tolerant teleportation on large, entangled stabilizer states using only single-qubit measurements, known as stabilizer pathfinding (SPF). For heralded loss, SPF is shown to generate optimally loss-tolerant measurement patterns on any given stabilizer state. Furthermore, SPF also provides highly loss-tolerant teleportation strategies when qubit loss is unheralded. We provide a fast algorithm for SPF that updates continuously as a state is generated and measured, which is therefore suitable for real-time implementation on a quantum-computing device. When compared to simulations of previous heuristics for loss-tolerant teleportation on graph states, SPF provides considerable gains in tolerance to both heralded and unheralded loss, achieving a near-perfect teleportation rate (>95%) in the regime of low qubit loss (<10%) on various graph state lattices. Using these results we also present evidence that points towards the existence of loss-tolerant thresholds on such states, which in turn indicates that the loss-tolerant behaviour we have found also applies as the number of qubits tends to infinity. Our results represent a significant advance towards the realistic implementation of teleportation in both large-scale and near-future quantum architectures that are susceptible to qubit loss, such as linear optical quantum computation and quantum communication networks.

In the future, as network virtualization technology advances, building and controlling a network for each service is expected to make the network suitable for the service. In this case, it is necessary to design the network construction and operation from the viewpoint of the quality of experience (QoE) of users. Although research on modeling QoE of users has been advanced, the QoE changes according to the user's psychological effect, so it can be hard to model the complete QoE in the conventional model. On the other hand, quantum decision-making has begun to be drawing attention in recent years as a model for expressing human cognitive state and decision-making. In quantum decision-making, it is possible to represent human behavior, which is hard to express in the conventional cognitive model, and it is expected as a more general model. In this paper, we implement the recommendation algorithm in MPEG-DASH, which recommends the user to select the appropriate bitrate by avoiding the cognitive bias captured by the quantum decision-making model.

In the experiment, the telecom band energy-time entangled photon pairs are generated through spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon waveguide. The arrival time of photons is registered for key generation and security test. High-dimensional encoding in the arrival time of photons is used to increase the information per coincidence of photon pairs. The bin sifting process is optimized by a three-level structure, which significantly reduces the raw quantum bit error rate (QBER) due to timing jitters of detectors and electronics. A raw key generation rate of 151 kbps with a QBER of 4.95% is achieved, in a time bin encoding format with 4 bits per coincidence. This experiment shows that the entanglement-based DO-QKD can be implemented in an efficient and convenient way, which has great potential for quantum secure communication networks in the future.

In particular, it provides the foundation for quantum key distribution (QKD), which promises a conceptual leap in information security. Entanglement-based QKD holds great promise for future applications owing to the possibility of device-independent security and the potential of establishing global-scale quantum repeater networks. While other approaches to QKD have already reached the level of maturity required for operation in absence of typical laboratory infrastructure, comparable field demonstrations of entanglement-based QKD have not been performed so far. Here, we report on the successful distribution of polarization-entangled photon pairs between Malta and Sicily over 96 km of submarine optical telecommunications fiber. We observe around 257 photon pairs per second, with a polarization visibility above 90%. Our results show that QKD based on polarization entanglement is now indeed viable in long-distance fiber links. This field demonstration marks the longest-distance distribution of entanglement in a deployed telecommunications network and demonstrates an international submarine quantum communication channel. This opens up myriad possibilities for future experiments and technological applications using existing infrastructure. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

However, there is currently no effective access authentication scheme for the NB-IoT system in the future 5G network. According to the current 3GPP standard, NB-IoT devices still use the traditional access authentication method to perform the mutual authentication with the network, which may bring a lot of signaling and communication overheads. This problem will be more prominent when sea of NB-IoT devices simultaneously are activated in the 5G network. In this paper, we propose a quantum-resistance access authentication and data distribution scheme for massive NB-IoT devices. This scheme can implement access authentication and data transmission for a group of NB-IoT devices at the same time based on the lattice-based homomorphic encryption technology. Our scheme can not only greatly reduce the network burden, but also can achieve the strong security including privacy protection and resisting quantum attacks. Performance analysis results show that our solution has the desired efficiency.

Unlike previous related works, hardware impairment, transmission efficiency, and energy consumption at the circuit and antennas are involved in massive MIMO networks. In order to ensure the QoS, we consider the minimum rate constraint for each user and the system, which increases the complexity of power allocation problem for maximizing energy and spectral efficiency in massive MIMO system. To this end, a quantum-inspired social emotional optimization (QSEO) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal power control strategy in massive MIMO uplink networks.

This scheme is assisted with the semi-honest third party to fulfill the task. And the genuine two-photon hyperentangled Bell states are utilized as the important information carriers. Different from the previous protocols, this hyperentangled Bell states are composed of only two photons but characterize six qubits in two longitudinal momentum and polarization degrees of freedom (DOFs). In addition, this protocol possesses a higher information capacity and saves massive quantum resources for that the two-photon system can carry 6 bits of information. Meanwhile, this scheme can be applied and useful for long-distance quantum communication to improve the feasibility of QPC protocol. Furthermore, 64 nonorthogonal single-photon states as decoy photons are utilized to detect the security of the quantum channel. This method not only increases the security of the quantum channel, but also decreases the decoherence effect of environment noise. Moreover, this QPC protocol is analyzed to be immune to various kinds of attack. Finally, this QPC protocol can obtain the good application to compare the secret inputs securely, efficiently and feasibly. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].

As security-hungry applications dramatically rise nowadays, a growing number of QKD networks are promising to be deployed in the immediate future. Nevertheless, a high-security-demand institution (e.g., a bank) needs to pay a high price to deploy its dedicated QKD network, while a cost-effective way of overcoming this challenge is to make multiple tenants share a QKD network. Each tenant represents a high-security-demand institution and can obtain secret keys on demand from the QKD network infrastructure for security purposes. Hence, how to achieve efficient and flexible multi-tenant provisioning over a QKD network becomes a crucial problem. This work introduces software defined networking (SDN) to address this problem. We experimentally demonstrate multi-tenant provisioning (including tenant establishment, adjustment, and deletion) over SDN-enabled metropolitan area QKD networks. A SDN-enabled metropolitan area QKD network architecture is introduced. We present a workflow, protocol extensions, and an on-demand secret-key resource allocation strategy for multi-tenant provisioning, which are all demonstrated by establishing an experimental testbed in the lab. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and flexibility of our SDN-based approaches for multi-tenant provisioning over metropolitan area QKD networks. Moreover, we conduct the simulation and discover the ways of improving the success probability of multi-tenant provisioning over metropolitan area QKD networks.

We account for the background noise present in the environment, as well as the Raman noise generated by classical channels, and calculate the secret key generation rate for quantum channels in the finite-key setting. This allows us to examine the feasibility of such systems in realistic scenarios when the secret key exchange needs to be achieved in a limited time scale. Our numerical results show that, by proper choice of system parameters for this noisy system, it is possible to exchange a secret key in tens of seconds.

When direct communication is not possible, QKD is performed over fiber cables, but the imperfections in detectors used at the receiver side and also the material properties of fiber cables limit the long-distance communication. Free space-based QKD is free from such limitations and can pave the way for satellite-based quantum communication to set up a global network for sharing secret messages. To implement free space optical links, it is essential to study the effect of atmospheric turbulence. Here, an analysis is made for satellite-based quantum communication using QKD protocols. We assume two specific attacks, namely PNS (photon number splitting) and IRUD (intercept-resend with unambiguous discrimination), which could be main threats for future QKD-based satellite applications. The key generation rates and the error rates of the considered QKD protocols are presented. Other parameters such as optimum signal and decoy states mean photon numbers are calculated for each protocol and distance. Further, in SARG04 QKD protocol with two decoy states, the optimum signal-state mean photon number is independent of the link distance and is valid for the attacks considered here. This is significant, highlighting its use in a realistic scenario of satellite quantum communication.

(2019),2019,Multi-tenant secret-key assignment over quantum key distribution networks,Optics Express,10.1364/OE.27.002544,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks are promising to progress towards widespread practical deployment over existing fiber infrastructures in the near future. Given the high cost and difficulty of deploying QKD networks, multi-tenancy becomes promising to improve cost efficiency for future QKD networks. In a multi-tenant QKD network, multiple QKD tenants can share the same QKD network infrastructure to obtain secret keys for securing their data transfer. Since the secret-key resources are finite and precious in QKD networks, how to achieve efficient multi-tenant secret-key assignment (MTKA) to satisfy the secret-key demands of multiple QKD tenants over QKD networks becomes a significant problem. In this regard, this study addresses the MTKA problem over QKD networks. A new multi-tenant QKD network architecture is proposed based on software defined networking (SDN) and quantum key pool (QKP) techniques. A secret-key rate sharing scheme is presented and a heuristic algorithm is designed to implement efficient MTKA over QKD networks. A new performance metric, namely matching degree (MD) that reflects the balance between QKD network secret-key resources and QKD tenant requests, is defined and evaluated. Simulation studies indicate that high QKD tenant requests accommodation and efficient secret-key resource usage can be achieved via maximizing the value of MD.

Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides long-term security without assuming the computational power of an adversary. However, inconsistencies between theory and experiment have raised questions in terms of real-world security, while large and power-hungry commercial systems have slowed wide-scale adoption. Measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) provides a method of sharing secret keys that removes all possible detector side-channel attacks which drastically improves security claims. In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate a key step required to perform MDI-QKD with scalable integrated devices.

Photonic routing and switching is expected to be exploited in future all-optical networks. Channel coding is needed in order to protect information against natural disturbances, and modern coding schemes are able to reach the ultimate limits predicted by Shannon. On the other hand, postquantum cryptography is necessary for assuring security against cyber attackers, possibly provided with quantum computers. Source coding, especially in video data compression, is recommended for optimizing the bandwidth usage. Spread spectrum systems can solve the problem of radio transmissions over common frequency bands. These technologies are of crucial importance for the evolution of networks and of the whole Internet, allowing people to interact each other and access information in the web.

533,5,C3,Slane (2019),2019,Future business models for space companies,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",,"This paper explores the evolution of the space company business model and suggests that future successful space companies will adopt open digitized architectures and use industry standards to optimize business opportunities and growth. Today in the space industry the ultimate customer is not a space company, but a terrestrial user of space data and information. Examples are easily identified as communications or remote sensing. Evolution in what is needed to support markets described in this paper are as a monolithic (vertically integrated) supply chain, a distributed, modular supply chain and, a near-term future space architecture and supply chain. Space companies have evolved over approximately the past two decades from monolithic architectures to distributed, modular architectures for purposes of flexibility, cost and growth opportunities. New Space economics puts added pressure on the industry to integrate with terrestrial capabilities. Future technologies will also drive greater integration with terrestrial capabilities. Original business models relied on integrated customers supplier relations for decades long development programs and multiple decade operations. Very high cost was justified by national needs, as was indemnification under government contracts. In the current space era new models exist because those factors have changed. While still costly, space services are coming to market with costs in the hundreds of millions of (US) dollars, not the billions of earlier solutions. Monolithic architectures have given way to more distributed modular concepts allowing for reduced costs over time. Insurance and industry standards use are significant additions to former practices. While struggling with these fundamental changes, global technological change continues unabated and will place greater additional pressure on space company business models due to blockchain technology and quantum computing together with associated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity.

534,6,C2,Haber et al. (2019),2019,Fundamentally secure data with the help of quantum key distribution on CubeSats,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",,"With the uprise of worldwide satellite communication networks, data security is a critical issue. This issue is being addressed in the QUBE project, which proposes a CubeSat for quantum cryptography experiments. The satellite and its subsystems are currently being developed and will be used for the downlink of individual photons, or strongly attenuated light pulses, containing encoded quantum information, which can then be employed for the exchange of encryption keys. The launch of the 3U Nanosatellite is planned for early 2020. It will be built using the UNISEC-Europe standard, which has demonstrated to be able to provide a robust structure for increased reliability in CubeSat missions. In addition to state-of-the-art reaction wheels for precision pointing, the satellite will be bringing the OSIRIS optical downlink system from DLR as well as two dedicated payloads for testing components required for quantum key distribution. A sequence of numbers will be created by a miniaturized quantum random number generator (QRNG), which will be used to set the quantum states of the light pulses. These pulses will then be downlinked to the optical ground station (OGS) at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The ground station is also equipped with the corresponding components for receiving individual quantum states. In addition, the random numbers will be made available via an RF downlink. The photon states received by the optical ground station will then be compared to the previously generated numbers. Due to the underlying quantum mechanics, any attempt of reading the quantum states will alter them, which makes interceptions easily detectable. These quantum key distribution experiments will evaluate whether secure communication links are possible even on a CubeSat scale. A major challenge for building the proposed CubeSat is the attitude determination and control system that will provide precise pointing. This work will outline detailed mission requirements as well as the chosen subsystems for tackling these challenges in order to achieve a successful mission and prepare for future data security.

535,5,C1,Hamilton et al. (2019),2019,Overview of NASA's national space quantum laboratory program,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",,"The development of entanglement-based quantum networks promises substantial benefit to quantum-enabled applications including distributed quantum sensing, improved timing/synchronization, multi-processor quantum computing over short-range interconnects, and distributed computing or secure communication over long-haul links. Photonic-based systems are the primary technology for realizing quantum networks due to the relative ease of photon transport while maintaining the quantum state. Significant development is required, however, to realize entanglement distribution rates commensurate with quantum network application requirements. In FY18, NASA initiated a hardware development program at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) to enable a series of near-term space-based quantum communication demonstrations that leverage the agency's significant investment in classical lasercom hardware pathfinders. Our program is focused on developing technology to enable entanglement-based quantum network demonstrations over satellite-based downlinks and crosslinks. Critical technology development underway today includes: precision synchronization, high-rate heralded entanglement sources and variable storage-time quantum memory. The ultimate goal of the program is to deploy this quantum communication infrastructure on the International Space Station to provide a National Space Quantum Laboratory (NSQL) that can be used collaboratively by the quantum information science research community to characterize new quantum technologies and evaluate new quantum system applications enabled by quantum states distributed over long distances. Quantum free-space communication links also require beam pointing, acquisition and tracking and a classical communication channel provided by RF or lasercom terminal technology. Today, MIT-LL is developing next-generation lasercom terminal hardware for NASA that will be used to demonstrate LEO-to-GEO bi-directional crosslinks and high-rate communications for Lunar downlinks. We envision that a near-term NASA free-space lasercom pathfinder will be leveraged to demonstrate NASA's first space quantum communication links. The Integrated LCRD Low-Earth Orbit User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T) program will host a next-generation lasercom terminal developed by MIT-LL on the International Space Station in the 2022 timeframe. The ILLUMA-T lasercom terminal integrated with a quantum modem can also be used to demonstrate high-rate space-to-ground entanglement distribution and explore the feasibility of dual-span ground-to-ground links and smallsat quantum crosslinks. In this presentation, we describe the objectives of NASA's NSQL quantum communications program and discuss key technologies employed in the space and ground terminals.

(2019),2019,Concepts for utilization of quantum communications and quantum key distribution,"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC",,"As secure space communications becomes more desirable, quantum-based communications systems have the potential to become a high performing option. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), with its partner institutions, is pursuing a variety of technology endeavours to enable the practical application of quantum communications in future NASA missions. This paper will discuss some of those technology areas. We will discuss methods being developed by GSFC and the University of Kansas for securing and auto-synchronizing communication over free-space optics using quantum key distribution and chaotic systems. In such a scenario, the security of the system would stem from the sensitivity to initial conditions. Furthermore, specific windows of single chaotic runs can be harvested to be used with encoder/decoder in a cyclic manner. Not only would the security of such a system be unique, the initial conditions can be transmitted via a quantum key distribution to add another layer of security to the system. We will discuss work being performed by GSFC and Michigan State University in analysis and development of solid-state quantum communications materials and devices. These will be necessary for devices capable of processing and routing quantum information on-board a spacecraft or within a quantum-capable ground station. In recent years, advancements in the understanding of quantum properties has led to a wide range of promising applications. One such application is orbital angular momentum (OAM) for secure optical communications being researched by partners at University of Wyoming and University of Illinois-Chicago. The utilization of OAM properties can be done via highly precise function values that can then be modulated using different constellations. Opportunities for quantum communications demonstrations exists in a variety of possible venues from balloons to CubeSats. We will discuss the potential for a low cost, high altitude balloon-to-balloon quantum communications demonstration to be carried out under the University of Wyoming Space Grant.

Automatic identification system (AIS) is a maritime navigation safety communication system that operates in the very high frequency mobile band and was developed primarily for collision avoidance. Since AIS is a one-way communication system which does not need to consider the target echo signal, it can estimate the atmospheric refractivity profile more accurately. Estimating atmospheric refractivity profiles from AIS signal power is a complex nonlinear optimization problem, the QPSO algorithm is adopted to search for the optimal solution from various refractivity parameters, and the inversion results are compared with those of the particle swarm optimization algorithm to validate the superiority of the QPSO algorithm. In order to test the anti-noise ability of the QPSO algorithm, the synthetic AIS signal power with different Gaussian noise levels is utilized to invert the surface-based duct. Simulation results indicate that the QPSO algorithm can invert the surface-based duct using AIS signal power accurately, which verify the feasibility of the new atmospheric refractivity estimation method based on the automatic identification system.

(2019),2019,Stratospheric QKD: Feasibility analysis and free-space optics system concept,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2539076,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the most mature quantum technologies and can provide quantum-safe security in future communication networks. Since QKD in fiber is limited to a range of few hundred kilometers, one approach to bridge continental scale distances may be the use of high altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS) as mobile trusted nodes in the stratosphere. In parallel, free-space laser communication for high rate data transmission has been a subject of research and development for several decades and its commercialization is progressing rapidly. Important synergies exist between classical free-space communication and QKD systems since the quantum states are often implemented using the same degrees of freedom such as polarization or field amplitude and phase. These synergies can be used to benefit from the progress in classical free-space laser communication in QKD applications. In this paper, the use case of QKD in a stratospheric environment is described wherein HAPS may serve as relay station of secret keys and encrypted data. The mission scenario and HAPS capabilities are analyzed to derive special requirements on the stratospheric laser terminal, the link geometry and the ground segment with respect to a feasibility demonstration. To obtain a flexible and compatible system, discrete variable and continuous variable QKD protocols are considered to be implemented side by side in the HAPS payload. Depending on the system parameters, it can be beneficial to use the one or the other kind of protocol. Thus, a direct comparison of both in one and the same system is of scientific interest. Each of the protocols has particular requirements on coupling efficiency and implementation. Link budget calculations are performed to analyze possible distances, key rates and data transmission rates for the different schemes. In case of the QKD system, the mean coupling efficiency is of main interest, i.e. signal fluctuations arising from atmospheric turbulence must be taken into account in the security proof, but the buffered key generation relaxes real-time requirements. This is different to classical communications, where the corresponding fading loss must be assessed. A system architecture is presented that comprises the optical aircraft terminal, the optical ground terminal and the most important subsystems that enable implementation of the considered QKD protocols. The aircraft terminal is interfaced with the dedicated quantum transmitter module (Alice) and the ground station with the dedicated quantum receiver module (Bob). The optical interfaces are SMF couplings which put high requirements on the receiving optics, in particular the need for wave-front correction with adaptive optics. The findings of the system study are reviewed and necessary next steps pointed out.

540,3,C3,Ji et al. (2019),2019,General Linear Group Action on Tensors: A Candidate for Post-quantum Cryptography,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10.1007/978-3-030-36030-6_11,"Starting from the one-way group action framework of Brassard and Yung (CryptoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢90), we revisit building cryptography based on group actions. Several previous candidates for one-way group actions no longer stand, due to progress both on classical algorithms (e.g., graph isomorphism) and quantum algorithms (e.g., discrete logarithm). We propose the general linear group action on tensors as a new candidate to build cryptography based on group actions. Recent works (FutornyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“GrochowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sergeichuk Lin. Alg. Appl., 2019) suggest that the underlying algorithmic problem, the tensor isomorphism problem, is the hardest one among several isomorphism testing problems arising from areas including coding theory, computational group theory, and multivariate cryptography. We present evidence to justify the viability of this proposal from comprehensive study of the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, theoretical algorithms, hardness results, as well as quantum algorithms. We then introduce a new notion called pseudorandom group actions to further develop group-action based cryptography. Briefly speaking, given a group G acting on a set S, we assume that it is hard to distinguish two distributions of (s,Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â t) either uniformly chosen from S ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ S, or where s is randomly chosen from S and t is the result of applying a random group action of gÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂµG on s. This subsumes the classical Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption when specialized to a particular group action. We carefully analyze various attack strategies that support instantiating this assumption by the general linear group action on tensors. Finally, we construct several cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures and pseudorandom functions. We give quantum security proofs based on the one-way group action assumption and the pseudorandom group action assumption.

In order to bridge this gap, we design and implement a low-cost 20 min demonstration of the Bell test, which is used in several entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocols. The demonstration introduces ideas such as the quantum state, quantum measurement, spin quantization, cryptography, and entanglement; all without using concepts beyond the 9th grade of the Chilean high-school curriculum. The demonstration can serve to promote early exposure of the future adopters and developers of quantum technology with its conceptual building blocks, and also to educate the general public about the importance of quantum mechanics in modern industry.

One of the most important challenges in WSNs is determining the operational mode of sensors, decreasing the energy consumption while the connectivity requirements and the special properties are satisfied. This problem is an NP-hard one and is a timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“consuming progress. In this study, an improved version of quadrivalent quantum-inspired gravitational search algorithm as a new metaheuristic, well suitable for quadrivalent problems is proposed using Not Q-Gate to optimize the performance of the WSN. Beside, to enhance the speed and the accuracy of the algorithm more, we used a parallelizing technique using Open-MP. Parallelizing this algorithm on mentioned problem is useful from four aspects; 1 - accelerate the speed of the algorithm, 2 - improving the quality of solutions by letting the increasing the population size, 3 - The possibility of using the algorithm, in larger-scale WSNs and 4 - power affectivity of the base station using multicore processors. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, a comparison between this approach and the previous methods is performed. Our experiments verified that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance more than 2.25 times and the speedup faster than 4 times on an 8-core CPU.

Prominent examples are hash functions for which collisions become known, or number-theoretic assumptions which are threatened by advances in quantum computing. Especially when it comes to key exchange protocols, the switch to quantum-resistant primitives has begun and aims to protect todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secrets against future developments, moving from common DiffieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hellman-based solutions to Learning-With-Errors-based approaches, often via intermediate hybrid designs. To this date there exists no security notion for key exchange protocols that could capture the scenario of breakdowns of arbitrary cryptographic primitives to argue security of prior or even ongoing and future sessions. In this work we extend the common BellareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rogaway model to capture breakdown resilience of key exchange protocols. Our extended model allows us to study security of a protocol even in case of unexpected failure of employed primitives, may it be number-theoretic assumptions, hash functions, signature schemes, key derivation functions, etc. We then apply our security model to analyze two real-world protocols, showing that breakdown resilience for certain primitives is achieved by both an authenticated variant of the post-quantum secure key encapsulation mechanism (Alkim et al.) which is a second round candidate in the Post Quantum Cryptography standardization process by NIST, as well as by TLSÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â 1.3, which has recently been standardized as RFCÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â 8446 by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

Although the future of WSNs is very prospective, the security issues become more and more important because they are used for very critical applications in engineering areas. Furthermore, they are very vulnerable and thus attractive to attacks because of human-unattended deployment and their limited prices. Generally, they are protected by public key cryptosystems. Such systems depends on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithms or integer factorizations. However, they can be attacked by Shor's algorithm on quantum computers. Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC) schemes are secure to attacks by quantum computers. Among such schemes, multivariate signatures use various multiplications in a finite field, which are time-consuming operations during signature generations. Thus, we focus on improving multiplications in finite fields for multivariate signatures. We propose a variant of Mastrovito multiplications based on trinomial, Special Trinomial (ST), pentanomial, Special Pentanomial (SP), Equally-spaced-polynomial (ESP), All-One-polynomial (AOP), and successive-one-polynomial (SOP). Our design is implemented on hardware and can be used to improve the implementations of multivariate signatures including UOV, enTTS and Rainbow for protecting data security in WSNs.

(2019),2019,Noise-suppressing channel allocation in dynamic DWDM-QKD networks using LightGBM,Optics Express,10.1364/OE.27.031741,"Integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) with existing optical networks is highly desired to reduce the deployment costs and achieve efficient resource utilization, and some point-to-point transmitting experiments have verified its feasibility. Nevertheless, there are still many problems in the realistic scenario where QKD coexists with dynamic data traffics. On the one hand, the conventional static channel allocation schemes cannot guarantee the quality of quantum channels in the presence of the time-varying noises. On the other hand, considering the complex noise generation caused by dynamic classical data traffics with variable characters, it is challenging to achieve online high-performance quantum channel assignments. To address these problems, we propose a machine learning based noise-suppressing channel allocation (ML-NSCA) scheme. In this scheme, the LightGBM based ML framework is trained to predict the optimal channel allocations with lowest noise impacts, according to which, the quantum channels are periodically reallocated to guarantee high secure key rate. To improve the accuracy and scalability of the ML framework, we also optimize the method of feature extraction during the training process. The performance evaluation results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively resist the dynamic noise impacts in the realistic optical networks and obtain higher secure key rate with less operation complexity than the previous schemes.

Multipliers are an important requirement in applications linked to Digital Signal Processing, Communication Systems, Optical Computing, Nanotechnology, Low-Power Very Large Scale Integration and Quantum Computing. Conventional mathematics makes multiplication a very long and time consuming process. The use of Vedic mathematics has led to great reduction in the time required for such calculations. The excessive use of Urdhava Tiryakbhyam sutra in multiplication surely proves its effectiveness and simplicity in this domain. This sutra supports the process of pipelining, a method employed in reduction of the power used by a system. Reversible logic has been gaining demand due to its low-power capabilities and is currently being used in many computing applications. The paper proposes two multiplier systems: one design employs the Urdhava Tiryakbhyam sutra along with pipelining and the second uses reversible logic gates into the first design. These proposed systems provide very less delay for result computation and low hardware utilization when compared to non-pipelined Vedic multipliers.

(2019),2019,Message authentication with a new quantum hash function,"Computers, Materials and Continua",10.32604/cmc.2019.05251,"To ensure the security during the communication, we often adopt different ways to encrypt the messages to resist various attacks. However, with the computing power improving, the existing encryption and authentication schemes are being faced with big challenges. We take the message authentication as an example into a careful consideration. Then, we proposed a new message authentication scheme with the Advanced Encryption Standard as the encryption function and the new quantum Hash function as the authentication function. Firstly, the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm is used to encrypt the result of the initial message cascading the corresponding Hash values, which ensures that the initial message can resist eavesdropping attack. Secondly, utilizing the new quantum Hash function with quantum walks can be much more secure than traditional classical Hash functions with keeping the common properties, such as one-wayness, resisting different collisions and easy implementation. Based on these two points, the message authentication scheme can be much more secure than previous ones.

550,6,C5,Jiang et al. (2019),2019,Cyclic Hybrid Double-Channel Quantum Communication via Bell-State and GHZ-State in Noisy Environments,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923322,"In this paper, a scheme for cyclic hybrid double-channel quantum communication is proposed by using the product state of three Bell states and three Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as the quantum channel. It shows that Alice teleports a single-qubit state to Bob and prepares a single-qubit state for Charlie, Bob teleports a single-qubit state to Charlie and prepares a single-qubit state for Alice, while Charlie teleports a single-qubit state to Alice and prepares a single-qubit state for Bob. The quantum channel is constructed by using Hadamard ( ${H}$ ) and Controlled-NOT (CNOT) operations. Participants reconstruct the desired states by performing Bell-state measurements, single-qubit measurements, and unitary transformations. Compared with existing schemes, this new scheme improves the efficiency and capacity of quantum communication because it constructs a cyclic and bidirectional quantum communication and simultaneously supports two communication protocols, quantum teleportation and remote state preparation. Only single-qubit measurements, two-qubit measurements, and basic unitary transformations are utilized in the scheme, so our operation complexity is lower than others. Thus, the scheme is likely to be implemented through physical experiments in the future. Besides this, we discuss the impact of noisy environments (amplitude-damping, phase-damping noise, bit-flip noise, and phase-flip noise) in the scheme and calculate the fidelities of the output states. It is demonstrated that the fidelities only depend on the coefficients of the initial state and the decoherence rate.

However, there are still problems which need to be solved, especially the route selection. Aiming at solving the convergence speed and optimization ability problems in network route selection, this paper proposes the quantum evolutionary algorithm. It improves it by adjusting the direction of the rotation angle and the function to optimize its performance while preserving the advantages of small scale and strong searching ability. It was found that the improved quantum evolution algorithm has faster search speed and more rigorous pursuit accuracy. It can play a better role in network route selection.

(2019),2019,All-dielectric metasurface grating for on-chip multi-channel orbital angular momentum generation and detection,Optics Express,10.1364/OE.27.018794,"Optical vortices, carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM) states, have been widely investigated because of their promising applications in both classical and quantum realms. Among these applications, efficient generation and measurement of OAM beams are critical. Current techniques available for generating OAM beams generally suffer from bulky size, low operation efficiency, or single-function or complicated fabrication processes. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach to generate arbitrary optical vortices with a chip-scale device based on all-dielectric two-dimensional (2D) polarization-independent metasurface grating. Based on multi-beam interference in principle and nanofabrication techniques for implementation, our device allows efficient and simultaneous on-chip generation of multi-channel beams with different OAM. We further demonstrate that our device can also work reversely in detecting the OAM spectrum of various pure and mixed optical vortices (e.g., fractional OAM orders) with low crosstalk. Our scheme may find potential applications in developing new integrated photonics for OAM-based high-dimensional quantum information processing in future quantum network.

However technical developments and early implementations cannot demonstrate its full capabilities, as the optical solution is mainly used in nonoptimized (SatCom) systems. To address the system level aspects ESA and its member states have implemented the operational European Data Relay System (EDRS) providing routine Quasi-Real-Time-Data Services to the European Commission Copernicus satellite fleet. Furthermore, a dedicated programme for Optical Communication was created called ScyLight which stands for a SeCure and Laser communication Technology Framework Programme. To integrate satellite and terrestrial networks ESA is now preparing its next logical step in optical communication systems by creating the elements for a High Throughput Opticial Network called HydRON. In HydRON optical interconnections in the Tbps (Terabit per second) region will be established including All-Optical payloads"" providing the means for a truly Fibre in Space network. Technically speaking HydRon is aiming for Tbps All-Optical Network"" solutions, dividing the satellite payload into a network part and an application part - similar to optical fiber networks on ground. The application is hooked to the network. HydRON will prepare Optical Feeder uplinks into a network of in orbit Technology Demonstrators (called HydRON#1, #2, etc.), which will be interconnected by means of Tbps laser intersatellite links. WDM Laser terminals (ground/space) and optical routing capabilities on-board the network nodes in space will be implemented together with optical payloads to enable a high throughput network connection to the applications. The space network concept will reduce the dependency on single ground stations as all HydRON nodes will get their particular data via the network they are interfacing with. A combination of new optical technologies, novel photonics equipment and efficient network concepts will be proven in orbit.

It is very much essential to bring down the energy utilization of every device deployed in IoT network without compromising the quality of service (QoS). Here, the difficulty of providing the operation between the QoS allocation and the energy competence for the industrial IoT application is deliberate. To achieve this objective, the multi-objective optimization problem to accomplish the aim of estimating the outage performance and the network lifetime is devised. Subsequently, proposed Hybrid Energy Efficient and QoS Aware (HEEQA) algorithm is a combination of quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) along with improved non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NGSA) to achieve energy balance among the devices is proposed and later the MAC layer parameters are tuned to reduce the further energy consumption of the devices. NSGA is applied to solve the problem of multi-objective optimization and the QPSO algorithm is used to gain the finest cooperative combination. The simulation outcome has put forward that the HEEQA algorithm has attained better operation balance between the energy competence and the QoS provisioning by minimizing the energy consumption, delay, transmission overhead and maximizing network lifetime, throughput and delivery ratio.

(2019),2019,Quantum Machine Learning for 6G Communication Networks: State-of-the-Art and Vision for the Future,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909490,"The upcoming fifth generation (5G) of wireless networks is expected to lay a foundation of intelligent networks with the provision of some isolated artificial intelligence (AI) operations. However, fully intelligent network orchestration and management for providing innovative services will only be realized in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few. Our vision for 6G is a massively connected complex network capable of rapidly responding to the users' service calls through real-time learning of the network state as described by the network edge (e.g., base-station locations and cache contents), air interface (e.g., radio spectrum and propagation channel), and the user-side (e.g., battery-life and locations). The multi-state, multi-dimensional nature of the network state, requiring the real-time knowledge, can be viewed as a quantum uncertainty problem. In this regard, the emerging paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing (QC), and quantum ML (QML) and their synergies with communication networks can be considered as core 6G enablers. Considering these potentials, starting with the 5G target services and enabling technologies, we provide a comprehensive review of the related state of the art in the domains of ML (including deep learning), QC, and QML and identify their potential benefits, issues, and use cases for their applications in the B5G networks. Subsequently, we propose a novel QC-assisted and QML-based framework for 6G communication networks while articulating its challenges and potential enabling technologies at the network infrastructure, network edge, air interface, and user end. Finally, some promising future research directions for the quantum- and QML-assisted B5G networks are identified and discussed.

(2019),2019,Rydberg-atom-based digital communication using a continuously tunable radio-frequency carrier,Optics Express,10.1364/OE.27.008848,"Up to now, the measurement of radio-frequency (RF) electric field achieved using the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) of Rydberg atoms has proved to be of high-sensitivity and shows a potential to produce a promising atomic RF receiver at resonance between two chosen Rydberg states. In this paper, we study the extension of the feasibility of digital communication via this quantum-based antenna over a continuously tunable RF-carrier at off-resonance. Our experiment shows that the digital communication at a rate of 500 kbps can be performed reliably within a tunable bandwidth of 200 MHz near a 10.22 GHz carrier. Outside of this range, the bit error rate (BER) increases, rising to, for example, 15% at an RF-detuning of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±150 MHz. In the measurement, the time-varying RF field is retrieved by detecting the optical power of the probe laser at the center frequency of RF-induced symmetric or asymmetric Autler-Townes splitting in EIT. Prior to the digital test, we studied the RF-reception quality as a function of various parameters including the RF detuning and found that a choice of linear gain response to the RF-amplitude can suppress the signal distortion. The modulating signal can be decoded at speeds up to 500 kHz in the tunable bandwidth. Our test consolidates the physical basis for reliable communication and spectral sensing over a wider broadband RF-carrier, which paves a way for the concurrent multi-channel communications founded on the same pair of Rydberg states.

It is known to be an NP-hard problem, so several meta-heuristics are applied for an approximate resolution. In this paper, we resolve the quality of service multicast routing problem (QoSMRP) with using a combined approach that uses a newly meta-heuristic called Dragonfly Algorithm (DFA) and Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA), we adopted a quantum representation of the solutions by a vector of continuous real values which allowed us to use the continuous version of the DFA without discretization, we also use the equation of DFA to calculate (formula Presented) in QEA. The interest of these contributions is to avoid premature convergence, to improve the diversity of solutions, and to increase the efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show the feasibility, scalability, and effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA), and Dragonfly Algorithm (DFA).

Quantum signals are transmitted in an outer core separately and intercore crosstalk (IC-XT) is the main impairment of them. In order to alleviate IC-XT, we propose a quantum-classical interleave scheme. Then the properties of IC-XT are analyzed based on the measurement results, which indicate counter-propagation is a better co-existence method than co-propagation. Finally, we perform QKD experiments in the presence of two classical channels with a channel spacing of 100 GHz between quantum channel and the nearest classical channels. The experiment results prove counter-propagation almost immune to IC-XT, which is consistent with our analysis. Also, the feasibility of the transmission over the range of metropolitan area networks is validated with our scheme.

To share such keys across the globe, space-based links are required and in the near term these will take the form of trusted node, key management satellites. We consider such channels between two nanosatellite spacecraft for polarization entanglement-based QKD, and the optical channel is described in detail. Quantum channels between satellites are useful for balancing keys within constellations of trusted node QKD satellites and, in the future, may have applications in long-distance qubit exchange between quantum computers and in fundamental physics experiments. The nanosatellite mission proposed uses an optical link with 80-mm diameter optical terminals. If such a link could be maintained with 10-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¼rad pointing accuracy, then this would allow QKD to be performed for satellite separations up to around 400 km. A potential pointing and tracking system is also described although currently this design would likely limit the satellite separation to 100 to 150 km.

(2019),2019,A New Lattice-Based Signature Scheme in Post-Quantum Blockchain Network,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2886554,"Blockchain technology has gained significant prominence in recent years due to its public, distributed, and decentration characteristics, which was widely applied in all walks of life requiring distributed trustless consensus. However, the most cryptographic protocols used in the current blockchain networks are susceptible to the quantum attack with rapid development of a sufficiently large quantum computer. In this paper, we first give an overview of the vulnerabilities of the modern blockchain networks to a quantum adversary and some potential post-quantum mitigation methods. Then, a new lattice-based signature scheme has been proposed, which can be used to secure the blockchain network over existing classical channels. Meanwhile, the public and private keys are generated by the Bonsai Trees technology with RandBasis algorithm from the root keys, which not only ensure the randomness, but also construct the lightweight nondeterministic wallets. Then, the proposed scheme can be proved secure in random oracle model, and it is also more efficient than similar literatures. In addition, we also give the detailed description of the post-quantum blockchain transaction. Furthermore, this work can help to enrich the research on the future post-quantum blockchain (PQB).

(2018),2018,Quantum Key Distribution over FSO: Current Development and Future Perspectives,Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium,10.23919/PIERS.2018.8597918,"Due to the recent rapid growth of computing technologies, today's encrypted information based on classical computational complexities will soon no longer remain secure. Quantum cryptography, or quantum key distribution (QKD), relying on the physical laws of quantum mechanics, stands out as a more powerful cryptographic solution that enables the secret key to be shared securely over publicly unsecured communication channels in the presence of eavesdroppers. QKD can be possibly implemented over both optical fiber and free-space optical (FSO) links. Compared to optical fiber, FSO has the immediate advantage of flexibility and cost-effectiveness in terms of infrastructure deployment. More interestingly, recent advancements in satellite communications using FSO links promise the future of a global QKD network for highly secure applications. This paper reviews the development of QKD over FSO for both terrestrial and satellite channels, which highlights the most up-to-date QKD protocols. Owing to how the information is encoded, different QKD protocols are classified into technology-focused categories, where their properties are reviewed and compared. The feasibility of current QKD protocols is then investigated with respect to its specific application scenarios for terrestrial and satellite FSO links, equipped with results from both theoretical and experimental studies. Based on the latest free-space QKD achievements, novel perspectives for future developments and challenges to enhance the secrecy performance and reduce implementation cost are then summarized and comprehensively discussed. The potential combination of QKD and physical layer cryptography for the newly emerging wireless mobile communications networks involved with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is also introduced.

Public key cryptography is widely used to securely send secret keys from sensor nodes to cloud server for subsequent decryption of sensors data. However, many popular public key encryption schemes (e.g. RSA and ECC) is deemed insecure in near future, due to algorithms running on quantum computers. In this paper, we present the implementation of high throughput NTRU encryption scheme in GPU, which can be used to secure the IoP communication against the quantum computer attack. On a GTX1080 NVIDIA GPU, our implementation can achieve 508,541 encryptions per second, which is capable in handling massive concurrent secure connections. According to the experimental results, Karatsuba polynomial multiplication proposed in this paper receives 20.6% improvement compared to the flat form implementation. Our implementation is constant time, which provides side channel resistant compared to the other work that utilizes product form and sparse form polynomial multiplication. The proposed solution can be used to secure communication between two parties, which is important for applications like smart home, biometric authentications and body area network.

The principle of operation of a fiber-optic quantum key distribution system with phase coding of photon states is described. The operation of the system in the mode of forming quantum keys is described. The synchronization process is analyzed, which consists in detecting a time interval with an optical pulse. The basic properties and parameters of auto-compensation quantum key distribution system are reviewed. The images of the current stand of the quantum-cryptographic network are given. The stand includes two stations of the quantum key distribution system with phase coding of photon states, two servers and data transmission channels. It is shown that the formation of a quantum key in the experiment is carried out at a rate of 500 bits per second. The length of the quantum communication channel in the experiment is 24 km. In this case, the quantum channel consists of a conventional singlemode optical fiber. Trends in the development of quantum key distribution systems, as well as trends in the development of protocols for quantum cryptography was conducted.

(2018),2018,Benchmarking treewidth as a practical component of tensor network simulations,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0207827,"Tensor networks are powerful factorization techniques which reduce resource requirements for numerically simulating principal quantum many-body systems and algorithms. The computational complexity of a tensor network simulation depends on the tensor ranks and the order in which they are contracted. Unfortunately, computing optimal contraction sequences (orderings) in general is known to be a computationally difficult (NP-complete) task. In 2005, Markov and Shi showed that optimal contraction sequences correspond to optimal (minimum width) tree decompositions of a tensor networkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s line graph, relating the contraction sequence problem to a rich literature in structural graph theory. While treewidth-based methods have largely been ignored in favor of dataset-specific algorithms in the prior tensor networks literature, we demonstrate their practical relevance for problems arising from two distinct methods used in quantum simulation: multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) datasets and quantum circuits generated by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We exhibit multiple regimes where treewidth-based algorithms outperform domain-specific algorithms, while demonstrating that the optimal choice of algorithm has a complex dependence on the network density, expected contraction complexity, and user run time requirements. We further provide an open source software framework designed with an emphasis on accessibility and extendability, enabling replicable experimental evaluations and future exploration of competing methods by practitioners.

The quantum information is carried by single photons with the binary codes represented by polarization states of the photons. Distribution of entangled photons between the ground and the satellite can be used to certify the quantum nature of the link: a guarantee that no eavesdropping can take place. By placing the entangled photon source on the ground, the space segments contains ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œonlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â the less complex detection system, enabling its implementation in a compact enclosure, compatible with the 12U CubeSat standard (ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã‚Â¼12 dm 3 ).

The space segment is also more versatile than one that contains the source since it is compatible with a multiple of QKD protocols (not restricted to entangled photon schemes) and can be used in quantum physics experiments, such as the investigation of entanglement decoherence. Other possible experiments include atmospheric transmission/turbulence characterization, dark area mapping, fine pointing and tracking, and accurate clock synchronization; all crucial for future global scale quantum communication efforts.

Efficient quantum encryption topologies between different end-users are also presented. We show experimentally the feasibility of a rapidly reconfigured QKD transmission system between multiple users in the proposed network. Classical data and control signals coexist with the quantum signals in the same fibre. Proof-of-concept experiments are conducted over effective transmission distances of 30 km, 31.7 km, 33.1 km, and 44.6 km. Software controlled QKD transmission is established between four different transmitters (Alice) and one receiver (Bob) with a switching time of a few milliseconds. The quantum bit error rates for the four paths are proportional to the channel losses with values between 2.6% and 4.1%. Optimization of the reconciliation and clock distribution architecture is predicted to result in a maximum key generation delay of 20 s, far shorter than previously demonstrated.

(2018),2018,COUNTDOWN - A run-time library for application-agnostic energy saving in MPI communication primitives,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,10.1145/3295816.3295818,"Energy and power consumption are prominent issues in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s supercomputers and are foreseen as a limiting factor of future installations. In scientific computing, a significant amount of power is spent in the communication and synchronization-related idle times among distributed processes participating to the same application. However, due to the time scale at which communication happens, taking advantage of low-power states to reduce power in idle times in the computing resources, may introduce significant overheads. In this paper we present COUNTDOWN, a methodology and a tool for identifying and automatically reducing the frequency of the computing elements in order to save energy during communication and synchronization primitives. COUNTDOWN is able to filter out phases which would detriment the time to solution of the application transparently to the user, without touching the application code nor requiring recompilation of the application. We tested our methodology in a production Tier-0 system, a production application - Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) - with production datasets which can scale up to 3.5K cores. Experimental results show that our methodology saves 22.36% of energy consumption with a performance penalty of 2.88% in real production MPI-based application.

In this paper, a novel quantum neural network called quantum weighted gated recurrent unit neural network (QWGRUNN) is proposed. Firstly, quantum bits are introduced into gated recurrent unit (GRU) to express network weights and activity values. Then, a new learning algorithm based on quantum phase-shift gate and quantum gradient descent is presented to quickly update the quantum parameters of weight-qubits and activity-qubits, thus endowing QWGRUNN with faster convergence speed, superior nonlinear approximation capability and higher computational efficiency than GRUNN. Performance degradation trend prediction for rolling bearings demonstrates that higher prediction accuracy and shorter computation time can be obtained due to the advantages of QWGRUNN in terms of convergence speed, nonlinear approximation capability and computational efficiency.

(2018),2018,Automated equivalence checking of concurrent quantum systems,ACM Transactions on Computational Logic,10.1145/3231597,"The novel field of quantum computation and quantum information has gathered significant momentum in the last few years. It has the potential to radically impact the future of information technology and influence the development of modern society. The construction of practical, general purpose quantum computers has been challenging, but quantum cryptographic and communication devices have been available in the commercial marketplace for several years. Quantum networks have been built in various cities around the world and a dedicated satellite has been launched by China to provide secure quantum communication. Such new technologies demand rigorous analysis and verification before they can be trusted in safety- and security-critical applications. Experience with classical hardware and software systems has shown the difficulty of achieving robust and reliable implementations. We present CCSq, a concurrent language for describing quantum systems, and develop verification techniques for checking equivalence between CCSq processes. CCSq has well-defined operational and superoperator semantics for protocols that are functional, in the sense of computing a deterministic input-output relation for all interleavings arising from concurrency in the system. We have implemented QEC (Quantum Equivalence Checker), a tool that takes the specification and implementation of quantum protocols, described in CCSq, and automatically checks their equivalence. QEC is the first fully automatic equivalence checking tool for concurrent quantum systems. For efficiency purposes, we restrict ourselves to Clifford operators in the stabilizer formalism, but we are able to verify protocols over all input states. We have specified and verified a collection of interesting and practical quantum protocols, ranging from quantum communication and quantum cryptography to quantum error correction.

(2018),2018,Quantum-inspired Boolean states for bounding engineering network reliability assessment,Structural Safety,10.1016/j.strusafe.2018.05.004,"Significant methodological progress has taken place to quantify the reliability of networked systems over the past decades. Both numerical and analytical methods have enjoyed improvements via a host of advanced Monte Carlo simulation strategies, state space partition methods, statistical learning, and Boolean functions among others. The latter approach exploits logic to approximate network reliability assessments efficiently while offering theoretical error guarantees. In parallel, physicists have made progress modeling complex systems via tensor networks (TNs), particularly quantum many-body systems. Inspired by the representation power of quantum TNs, this paper offers a new approach to efficiently bound all-terminal network reliability (ATR). It does so by exactly solving a related network Boolean satisfiability counting problem (or #SATNET), represented as a TN, by counting configurations in which all network nodes are connected to at least a neighbor. Our #SATNET counting outperforms state-of-the-art approximate and exact counters for the same problem as shown for challenging two-dimensional lattice networks of increasing size. While the over-counting from #SATNET increases exponentially relative to the number of configurations that satisfy ATR problems (or #RELAT), the bias is predictable for ideal networks, such as lattices, and our upper-bound is guaranteed with 100% confidence. This bound also cuts through the upper bound from other analytical methods for the ATR problem, such as recursive decomposition algorithms (RDA)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âa desirable feature when exact or approximate methods with error guarantees fail to scale. Clearly, our goal is not to solve the general stochastic network reliability problem, which remains a #P problem in the computational complexity hierarchy (i.e., a counting version of non-deterministic polynomial time [NP] problems for which there is no known polynomial time algorithms to find their solutions). Instead, we present a novel bounding technique for network reliability, which relies on exactly counting configurations for our network satisfiability problem by using quantum computing principles. We offer a proof for the counting bound to hold in a connectivity ATR sense, and illustrate trends with cubic and lattice networks. Overall, the proposed method provides an alternative to available system reliability assessment approaches, and opens directions for future research, especially as discoveries in logic, algebraic projections, and quantum computation continue to accrue.

However, these problems will be unsecure when facing the attack of quantum computers. Motivated by these concerns, we proposed a blind proxy re-signature scheme based on the problem of isomorphisms of polynomials, which can resist quantum attack, and gave its security proof under the random oracle model. In the proposed scheme, the message can be kept blind by using the hash function, and the delegatee's identity can be kept anonymous by using the problem of isomorphisms of polynomials. Compared with the existing schemes, the new scheme has more secure properties, such as quantum resistance, high efficiency, message blindness, and delegatee anonymity. It is concluded that the proposed scheme has a good application prospect in the future quantum computing environment with low-power hardware.

This overload can have negative impacts in terms of delays and termination of security procedures, like authentication, affecting both HTC and MTC.

(2018),2018,Dynamic Adaptable Asynchronous Progress Model for MPI RMA Multiphase Applications,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,10.1109/TPDS.2018.2815568,"Casper is a process-based asynchronous progress model for MPI one-sided communication on multi-and many-core architectures. The one-sided communication is not truly one-sided in most MPI implementations: the target process still relies on software progress to complete incoming operations. Casper allows the user to specify an arbitrary number of cores dedicated to background ghost processes and transparently redirects the RMA operations to ghost processes by utilizing the PMPI redirection and MPI-3 shared-memory technologies. Although Casper benefits applications that suffer from lack of asynchronous progress, the operation redirection design might not support complex multiphase applications effectively, which often involve dynamically changing communication density and computing workloads. In this paper, we present an adaptive mechanism in Casper to address the limitation of static asynchronous progress in multiphase applications. We exploit two adaptive strategies, a user-guided strategy and a fully transparent and automatic strategy based on self-profiling and prediction, to dynamically reconfigure the asynchronous progress in Casper according to real-time performance characteristics during multiphase execution. We evaluate the adaptive approaches in both microbenchmarks and a real quantum chemistry application suite, NWChem, on the Cray XC30 supercomputer and an Intel Omni-Path cluster.

As the Moore's Law era of computing draws to a close, the development of non-Von Neumann systems: neuromorphic processing units, and quantum annealers; again are redefining new territory for computational methods. While these technologies are still in their nascent stages, we discuss their potential to advance computing in two domains: machine learning, and solving constraint satisfaction problems. Each of these processors utilize fundamentally different theoretical models of computation. This raises questions about how to best use them in the design and implementation of applications. While many processors are being developed with a specific domain target, the ubiquity of spin-glass models and neural networks provides an avenue for multi-functional applications. This provides hints at the future infrastructure needed to integrate many next-generation processing units into conventional high-performance computing systems.

However, there are many negative features of the atmospheric channel that will reduce the achievable secret key rate, such as beam extinction and a variety of turbulence effects. Here we show how these factors affect performance of CVQKD, by considering our newly derived key rate formulas for fading channels, which involves detection imperfections, thus form a transmission model for CVQKD. This model can help evaluate the feasibility of experiment scheme in practical applications. We found that performance deterioration of horizontal link within the boundary layer is primarily caused by transmittance fluctuations (including beam wandering, broadening, deformation, and scintillation), while transmittance change due to pulse broadening under weak turbulence is negligible. Besides, we also found that communication interruptions can also cause a perceptible key rate reduction when the transmission distance is longer, while phase excess noise due to arrival time fluctuations requires new compensation techniques to reduce it to a negligible level. Furthermore, it is found that performing homodyne detection enables longer transmission distances, whereas heterodyne allows higher achievable key rate over short distances.

In this paper we introduce several decoding algorithms complemented by deep neural decoders (DND) and apply them to analyze several fault-tolerant error correction (EC) protocols such as the surface code as well as Steane and Knill EC. Our methods require no knowledge of the underlying noise model afflicting the quantum device making them appealing for real-world experiments. Our analysis is based on a full circuit-level noise model. It considers both distance-three and five codes, and is performed near the codes pseudo-threshold regime. Training DND in low noise rate regimes appears to be a challenging machine learning endeavour. We provide a detailed description of our neural network architectures and training methodology. We then discuss both the advantages and limitations of DND. Lastly, we provide a rigorous analysis of the decoding runtime of trained DND and compare our methods with anticipated gate times in future quantum devices. Given the broad applications of our decoding schemes, we believe that the methods presented in this paper could have practical applications for near term fault-tolerant experiments.

Inspired by probabilistic interpretation of quantum physics, we propose a generative model using matrix product states, which is a tensor network originally proposed for describing (particularly one-dimensional) entangled quantum states. Our model enjoys efficient learning analogous to the density matrix renormalization group method, which allows dynamically adjusting dimensions of the tensors and offers an efficient direct sampling approach for generative tasks. We apply our method to generative modeling of several standard data sets including the Bars and Stripes random binary patterns and the MNIST handwritten digits to illustrate the abilities, features, and drawbacks of our model over popular generative models such as the Hopfield model, Boltzmann machines, and generative adversarial networks. Our work sheds light on many interesting directions of future exploration in the development of quantum-inspired algorithms for unsupervised machine learning, which are promisingly possible to realize on quantum devices.

Military forces all over the world have come to value the new role of cyberspace in warfare, building up cyber commands, and establishing new capabilities. Integral to such capabilities is that military forces fundamentally depend on the rapid exchange of information in order for their decision-making processes to gain superiority on the battlefield; this compounds the need to develop network- enabled capabilities to realize network-centric warfare. This triangle of cyber offense, cyber defence, and cyber dependence creates a challenging and complex system of interdependencies. Alongside, while numerous technologies have not improved cyber security significantly, this may change with upcoming new concepts and systems, like decentralized ledger technologies (Blockchains) or quantum-secured communication. Following these thoughts, the paper analyses the development of both cyber threats and defence capabilities during the past 10 years, evaluates the current situation and gives recommendations for improvements. To this end, the paper is structured as follows: first, general conditions for military forces with respect to ""cyber"" are described, including an analysis of the most likely courses of action of the West and their seemingly traditional adversary in the East, Russia. The overview includes a discussion of the usefulness of the measures and an overview of upcoming technologies critical for cyber security.

QC or more specifically quantum key distribution (QKD) promises unconditionally secure protocol, the Holy Grail of communication and information security, that is based on the fundamental laws of quantum physics. In this talk, we will discuss our latest experiments on a four-state (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying 'QPSK') RF sub-carrier assisted continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) multi-user network based on ultra low loss quantum channel (pure silica core fiber 'PSCF') and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based add/drop switch. A coherent receiver with local local oscillator (LLO) is implemented, which ideally could not be accessed by eavesdroppers (Eve), aided with digital signal processing (DSP) module for phase noise cancellation (PNC). With 10 Gbit/s QPSK classical WDM signals, we have recorded secure key rates of 8.65 Mbit/s over 20 km and upto 12 Mbit/s over lossless channel. The experimental setup is further extended to a optically switched multi-user network, i.e. multiple Bobs, for implementing add/drop operations to achieve key rates of 5.98 Mbit/s for a 2 -2 MEMS switch. It is expected that the proposed cost-effective and energy efficient QKD network can facilitate the practical application of the CV-QKD protocol on commercial scale in near future for smart access networks.

Three limitations of this approach are that (1) they are based on a simple layered network topology, i.e., highly connected layers, without intra-layer connections; (2) the networks are manually configured to achieve optimal results, and (3) the implementation of the network model is expensive in both cost and power. In this article, we evaluate deep learning models using three different computing architectures to address these problems: quantum computing to train complex topologies, high performance computing to automatically determine network topology, and neuromorphic computing for a low-power hardware implementation. We use the MNIST dataset for our experiment, due to input size limitations of current quantum computers. Our results show the feasibility of using the three architectures in tandem to address the above deep learning limitations.We show that a quantum computer can find high quality values of intra-layer connection weights in a tractable time as the complexity of the network increases, a high performance computer can find optimal layer-based topologies, and a neuromorphic computer can represent the complex topology and weights derived from the other architectures in low power memristive hardware.

Design/methodology/approach: E-mail based social network analysis creates virtual maps of communication ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ social landscapes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ of organizations, similar to Google Maps, which creates geographical maps of a personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surroundings. Findings: Applying virtual mirroring-based learning at various mulitnational firms has significantly increased their organizational efficiency and performance, for instance increasing customer satisfaction by 18 per cent in a large services organization, increasing retention, making sales forecasts, and improving call center employee satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: To address concerns of individual privacy, the guiding principle is to give individual information to the individual and provide aggregated anonymized information to management. Originality/value: Virtual mirroring-based learning offers a unique way of creating collective awareness within an organization by empowering the individual to take corrective action aligned with collective action, and improves their own communication behavior through analyzing and visualizing their e-mail archive in novel ways, while giving strategic insight to management and improving organizational culture.

To achieve desirable scaling, it is therefore crucial to implement unitary transformations in a time that scales at most polynomial in the number of qubits. We develop an upper bound for the minimum time required to implement a unitary transformation on a generic qubit network in which each of the qubits is subject to local time dependent controls. Based on the developed upper bound, the set of gates is characterized that can be implemented polynomially in time. Furthermore, we show how qubit systems can be concatenated through controllable two body interactions, making it possible to implement the gate set efficiently on the combined system. Finally, a system is identified for which the gate set can be implemented with fewer controls.

Owing to the highly efficient mass transport and information transmission, neurons are exactly a perfect model for electron transport, inspiring us to design a neuron-like reaction network for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with Fe3O4 as an example. The reactive cores (Fe3O4) are protected by carbon shells and linked by carbon filaments, constituting an integrated conductance network. Thus, once the reaction starts, the electrons released from every Fe3O4 cores are capable of being transferred rapidly through the whole network directly to the external circuit, endowing the nanocomposite with tremendous rate performance and ultralong cycle life. After 1000 cycles at current densities as high as 1 and 2 A g-1, charge capacities of the as-synthesized nanocomposite maintain 971 and 715 mA h g-1, respectively, much higher than those of reported Fe3O4-based anode materials. The Fe3O4-based conductive network provides a new idea for future developments of high-rate-performance LIBs.

In particular, we focus on the channel transmittances and the excess noise which are affected by atmospheric turbulence, surface roughness, zenith angle of the satellite, wind speed, submarine depth, etc. The estimation method is based on proposed algorithms and is applied to low-Earth orbits using the Monte Carlo approach. For light at 550 nm with a repetition frequency of 1 MHz, the effects of the estimated parameters on the performance of the CV-QKD system are assessed by a simulation by comparing the secret key bit rate in the daytime and at night. Our results show the feasibility of satellite-to-submarine CV-QKD, providing an unconditionally secure approach to achieve global networks for underwater communications.

The advantage of this scheme is twofold: first, the majority of complex and critical equipment is ground based; second, one satellite design is compatible with a variety of quantum optical experiments. We provide a complete link loss analysis, count rate estimations and preliminary design. Further we discuss solutions to key problems such as satellite pointing errors and measurement/detection issues.

First, we investigate the tolerance of the CV-QKD system to spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) noise, the latter being the most dominant impairment in a WDM co-existence environment for QKD. In particular, we investigate by experiment the impact of a WDM 10ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€times 10 Gb/s ON-OFF-keying signal in terms of induced SRS noise in the QKD channel. The spontaneous SRS noise influence is assessed for different transmission scenarios, i.e., for various optical launch powers of the WDM signal, and for different transmission links of 20, 40, 60, and 80 km. Based on the experimental data and on the measured system's parameters, we estimate the key rates and reach capabilities of the proposed CV-QKD system. The scheme supports a key rate of 90 kbit/s over 20 km, for an ideal QKD system multiplexed with 2-mW optical power.

Firstly, the MEEMD method is employed to decompose the traffic data sequence into intrinsic mode function (IMF) component. Then, the Quantum Neural Network is adopted to forecast the IMF components. Ultimately, the final prediction value is obtained via synthe-tizing the prediction results of all components. The QNN is composed of universal quantum gates and quantum weighted, and its learning algorithm employs the Modified PolakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“RibiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨reÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Polyak Conjugate Gradient method.

The proposed algorithm is capable of estimating the distance between two non-neighboring sensors for multi-hop heterogeneous wireless sensor networks where all nodesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ communication ranges are different. Firstly, we construct a new cumulative distribution function of expected hop progress for sensor nodes with different transmission capability. Then, the distance between any two nodes can be computed accurately and effectively by deriving the mathematical expectation of cumulative distribution function. Finally, quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to improve the positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior in the localization accuracy and efficiency when used in random and uniform placement of nodes for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks.

However, due to the limited node communication and computing power, the traditional public key encryption algorithm can't be effectively applied. And as step into post-quantum era, pairing related assumption is fragile. Lattice is an ideal choice for building secure encryption scheme against quantum attack. Based on this, we propose a public encryption with key search scheme from lattice for wireless sensor networks. Compared with the existing public searchable encryption algorithm, the proposed encryption algorithm requires less computation time and achieves more security level.

On the base of the double-chain deployment structure of anchor nodes in coal-mine underground, the largest RSSI signals received from the anchor nodes are processed by the filter with Gauss density function, and the coordinates of the unknown nodes are calculated directly by the filtered RSSI signals and exponential factors. The exponential factors are optimized by an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm and the criterion of the root mean square error minimum. The algorithm proposed has the advantage of fast positioning speed and low computational complexity and the simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm, which can be suitable for real time positioning system in coal mine underground wireless sensor networks.

The desire to reduce costs and increase robustness in real-world applications has motivated the study of coexistence between QKD and intense classical data tra c in a single fiber. Previous works on coexistence in metropolitan areas have used wavelength-division multiplexing, however, coexistence in backbone fiber networks remains a great experimental challenge, as Tbps data of up to 20 dBm optical power is transferred, and much more noise is generated for QKD. Here we present for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the integration of QKD with a commercial backbone network of 3.6 Tbps classical data at 21 dBm launch power over 66 km fiber. With 20 GHz pass-band filtering and large e ective core area fibers, real-time secure key rates can reach 4.5 kbps and 5.1 kbps for co-propagation and counter-propagation at the maximum launch power, respectively. This demonstrates feasibility and represents an important step towards building a quantum network that coexists with the current backbone fiber infrastructure of classical communications.

These solutions must be secure against classical and post-quantum cryptanalysis techniques as well as feasible for all kinds of devices, including energy-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The quantum immunity can be implemented in the cryptographic layer, e.g., by using recent lattice-based key exchange algorithms NewHope or Frodo, or in the physical layer of wireless communication, by utilizing eavesdropping-resistant secrecy coding techniques. In this study, we explore and compare the feasibility and energy efficiency of selected cryptographic layer and physical layer approaches by applying an evaluation approach that is based on simulation and modeling. In particular, we consider NewHope and Frodo key exchange algorithms as well as novel physical layer secrecy coding approach that is based on polar codes. The results reveal that our proposed physical layer implementation is very competitive with respect to the cryptographic solutions, particularly in short-range wireless communication. We also observed that the total energy consumption is unequally divided between transmitting and receiving devices in all the studied approaches. This may be an advantage when designing security architectures for energy-restricted devices. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2018 by the authors.

Because of technology limitations which do not allow large quantum computers to work as a single processing element, distributed quantum computation is an appropriate solution to overcome this difficulty. Previous studies have applied ad-hoc solutions to distribute a quantum system for special cases and applications. In this study, a general approach is proposed to optimize the number of teleportations for a DQC consisting of two spatially separated and long-distance quantum subsystems. To this end, different configurations of locations for executing gates whose qubits are in distinct subsystems are considered and for each of these configurations, the proposed algorithm is run to find the minimum number of required teleportations. Finally, the configuration which leads to the minimum number of teleportations is reported. The proposed method can be used as an automated procedure to find the configuration with the optimal communication cost for the DQC. This cost can be used as a basic measure of the communication cost for future works in the distributed quantum circuits.

A basic objective is to keep the required resources to implement arithmetic as low as possible. This applies in particular to the number of qubits required in the implementation as for the foreseeable future this number is expected to be small. We present a reversible circuit for integer multiplication that is inspired by Karatsuba's recursive method. The main improvement over circuits that have been previously reported in the literature is an asymptotic reduction of the amount of space required from O(n1.585) to O(n1.427). This improvement is obtained in exchange for a small constant increase in the number of operations by a factor less than 2 and a small asymptotic increase in depth for the parallel version. The asymptotic improvement are obtained from analyzing pebble games on complete ternary trees.

However, all of this previous research seldom focused on the routing mechanism of QKD network in detail. Therefore, this paper focuses on the routing issue in trust relaying QKD network, builds a model of the trust relaying QKD network and proposes a secret-key-Aware routing method. In our method, a dynamic model for the residual local key is proposed to forecast the residual local key quantity of each QKD link more accurately, and the cost of QKD link and relaying path are defined by multiple affecting factors, e.g. the generation, consumption rate and the local key depletion index. The proposed method is implemented and evaluated in a simulation environment. The simulation results show that our routing method can increase the success rate of key exchange, make all the QKD links participate key exchange with almost equal opportunity to achieve load balance, and trade off the local key generation and consumption of each QKD link. Therefore, our proposed method can contribute to effectively improve the holistic performance of the trust relaying QKD network. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2018 Editorial Department of China Communications.

(2018),2018,A nanomaterial release model for waste shredding using a Bayesian belief network,Journal of Nanoparticle Research,10.1007/s11051-018-4137-2,"The shredding of waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and other products, incorporated with nanomaterials, can lead to a substantial release of nanomaterials. Considering the uncertainty, complexity, and scarcity of experimental data on release, we present the development of a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model. This baseline model aims to give a first prediction of the release of nanomaterials (excluding nanofibers) during their mechanical shredding. With a focus on the description of the model development methodology, we characterize nanomaterial release in terms of number, size, mass, and composition of released particles. Through a sensitivity analysis of the model, we find the material-specific parameters like affinity of nanomaterials to the matrix of the composite and their state of dispersion inside the matrix to reduce the nanomaterial release up to 50%. The shredder-specific parameters like number of shafts in a shredder and input and output size of the material for shredding could minimize it up to 98%. The comparison with two experimental test cases shows promising outcome on the prediction capacity of the model. As additional experimental data on nanomaterial release becomes available, the model is able to further adapt and update risk forecasts. When adapting the model with additional expert beliefs, experts should be selected using criteria, e.g., substantial contribution to nanomaterial and/or particulate matter release-related scientific literature, the capacity and willingness to contribute to further development of the BBN model, and openness to accepting deviating opinions.

We also show that any code attempting to exceed this upper bound must incur large error in decoding, which can be viewed as a weaker version of the strong converse results for quantum capacity. As an application, we find nearly matching upper and lower bounds (up to an additive constant) on the quantum capacity of quantum expander channels. Using these techniques, we further conclude that the 'mixture of random unitaries' channels arising in the construction of quantum expanders in [Hastings 2007] show a trend in multiplicativity of output 2-norm similar to that exhibited in [Montanaro 2013] for output Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“-norm of random quantum channels.

The ability of these algorithms to detect complex patterns in data which are extremely difficult to achieve manually, helps to produce effective predictive models. Whilst computer architects have been accelerating the performance of machine learning algorithms with GPUs and custom hardware, there have been few implementations leveraging these algorithms to improve the computer system performance. The work that has been conducted, however, has produced considerably promising results. The purpose of this paper is to serve as a foundational base and guide to future computer architecture research seeking to make use of machine learning models for improving system efficiency. We describe a method that highlights when, why, and how to utilize machine learning models for improving system performance and provide a relevant example showcasing the effectiveness of applying machine learning in computer architecture. We describe a process of data generation every execution quantum and parameter engineering. This is followed by a survey of a set of popular machine learning models. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide an evaluation of implementations for the purpose of creating a workload performance predictor for different core types in an x86 processor.

(2018),2018,Beam-hopping systems for next-generation satellite communication systems,Satellite Communications in the 5G Era,10.1049/PBTE079E_ch10,"In this chapter, the concepts and benefits of beam-hopping were presented along with some detection performance considerations. In particular, the gains in user satisfaction and system usable throughput were compared to that of a conventional broadband satellite system with a static coverage. Complementing the beam-hopping system principles, we discussed the physical layer transmission solutions suitable for beamhopping. Based on the identified waveform key-requirements for applying beamhopping, the already released DVB-S2X standard was reviewed and analysed using practical and representative system examples. It was found that the super-framing specification offers high practical relevance compared to the conventional DVBS2/S2X framing. The author also presented actual and future technology for a beam-hopping systems. Specifically, the upcoming Eutelsat Quantum-class satellite designed for beamhopping was presented along with its features like re-configurable beam-forming and highlights potential applications. The corresponding ground equipment was also discussed exploiting the advantages of wideband processing. Furthermore, implementation feasibility has been demonstrated by means of detection performance results exploiting DVB-S2X SF Format 4. Beam-hopping offers flexible system architecture to address changing traffic demands over time and geographical locations by sharing in time, power and frequency resources among multiple beams. Beam-hopping systems offer higher usable throughput by focusing the system resources where they are most needed at a time.

(2018),2018,Optimal Distributed Generation Allocation Using Quantum Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization,Studies in Big Data,10.1007/978-3-319-63639-9_17,"Distributed Generation (DG), with respect to its ability in utilizing the alternative resources of energy, provides a promising future for power generation in electrical networks. Distributed generators contribution to the power systems includes improvement in energy efficiency and power quality to reliability and security. These benefits are only achievable with optimal allocation of distributed resources that considers the objective function, constraints, and employs a suitable optimization algorithm. In this chapter, a quantum inspired computational intelligence is exercised for the optimal allocation of distributed generators. The fact that most of power system optimization problems, when modelled accurately, are of non-convex and sometimes discrete nature has encouraged many researchers to develop optimization techniques to overcome such difficulties. The basic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most favored optimization techniques with many attractive features. Early experiments of employing PSO in many applications in power systems have indicated its promising potential. Consequently, the more advanced alternatives of this algorithm such as Quantum behaved PSO (Q-PSO) may show the same or even better performance in power system problems. The aforementioned algorithm has already been employed for different optimization objectives in power systems such as: short-term non-convex economic scheduling, unit commitment problems, loss of power minimization, economic load dispatch, smart building energy management and power system operations. Nevertheless, the algorithm has never been used for optimal allocation of distributed generation units. In this chapter the above problem will be solved with a quantum behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The chapter will be started with an introduction to the optimal allocation of DG then the power system, including the DG units will be modeled. On the next step the Q-PSO will be adopted for the optimal allocation. Finally, the results and discussions will be presented.

Their success for one dimensional problems, together with the fact that they do not suffer from the sign problem and can address the simulation of real time evolution, have turned them into one of the most promising techniques to study strongly correlated systems. In the realm of Lattice Gauge Theories they can offer an alternative to standard lattice Monte Carlo calculations, which are suited for static properties and regimes where no sign problem appears. The application of Tensor Networks to this kind of problems is a young but rapidly evolving research field.

In a world held captive by constantly emerging stories of cyber-attacks, national security breaches, and government mass surveillance; issues involving privacy and communication technology are now at the forefront of cultural dialogue. Within the past several years, secure communication icons like Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, and Anonymous have become household names, greatly influencing international politics and mainstream media. The key ingredient to many of these world-changing events is reliable encryption methods, allowing information activists to securely and anonymously communicate anything from personal emails to top secret government files. Although issues related to encryption source code have been adjudicated in the federal court system with some positive results, the future of cryptography-specifically advances associated with quantum cryptography (quantum key distribution)-remains unsecured under both federal First Amendment jurisprudence and the EAR. This article will seek to illuminate the legal landscape surrounding encryption and suggest both judicial and regulatory clarifications to help ensure the future accessibility and use of quantum encryption technology. This article will first provide a brief overview of how modern commercial encryption works, describing how it has advanced in recent years from fairly straightforward computer software to ultra-sophisticated methods of transmitting secret keys using the physics of quantum entanglement.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ Next, it will summarize key court decisions related to encryption and the first amendment; namely, Junger v. Daley and Bernstein v. Department of Justice. This article will then analyze the current regulatory framework for the export of quantum cryptography technologies under Category 5, Part 2 of the Export Administration Regulation's Commerce Control List. Finally, this article will assess-in light of current EAR regulations and Junger/Daley-whether the future development and potential widespread public use of quantum cryptographic technology in the United States is at risk under the current judicial landscape/export regulatory regime, and what changes are necessary to protect it.

The team is developing technologies such as QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) which harness unique properties of quantum physics to enable highly secured encryption services. QKD can generate encryption keys that are secure against computational hacks and that can be distributed to remote parties with solid guarantees that they have not been intercepted by man-in-the-middle eavesdroppers. Currently, most encryption keys derive their security from complex mathematical functions that require unfeasibly large classical computers to crack, but quantum computers are coming online soon that will compromise many of these keys. Since QKD derives its security from fundamental physical laws it is provably secure against future computational developments. QKD requires that information be transmitted optically, typically with bits encoded in individual photons that must be uniquely distinguished and timestamped at the transmitter and receiver. Accordingly, the signals are very weak and susceptible to loss compared with classical laser communications. Within optical fibres they are restricted to distances of 50-100km before physically secured, trusted repeater stations are required. Using free-space optics the losses are lower and by delivering QKD from space the entire world can be connected securely. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

With the recent success of space based experimental QKD systems, researchers are now focussing on implementing more practical and efficient QKD systems that meet the challenges faced in space-based implementations. One pressing problem is the need for efficient and easy to implement reconciliation schemes for practical QKD systems. Rate-adaptive schemes based on LDPC codes constitute an appealing implementation of the key reconciliation process since they cover the entire range of the channel parameter space with a limited set of pre-defined Mother codes. In this paper, we investigate in detail some rate- adaptive reconciliation schemes based on LDPC codes, illustrating how their performance compares to other set-ups in which fixed-rate non- adaptive LDPC codes optimised for different channel conditions are adopted. In particular, the impact rate-adaptive codes have on decoding complexity, and subsequently the overall secure key throughput, is quantified through full blown simulations of an entanglement-based version of the QKD protocol within the context of an entanglement source onboard a satellite. Our work highlights that even though rate adaptive schemes schemes for QKD reconciliation appear ideal for future space-based implementations of single- photon QKD, identification of ideal Mother codes for such schemes remains to be resolved.

The framework builds upon recent advances in amortized inference methods that use both an inference network and a refinement procedure to output samples from a variational distribution given an observation sequence, and takes advantage of the duality between control and inference to approximately solve the intractable inference problem using the path integral control approach. The learned dynamical model can be used to predict and plan the future states; we also present the efficient planning method that exploits the learned low-dimensional latent dynamics. Numerical experiments show that the proposed path-integral control based variational inference method leads to tighter lower bounds in statistical model learning of sequential data.

Along these lines, ITS aim at providing sophisticated management models and tools across all transport modes. Therefore designing models that resist future attacks is an important area of research and standardization, in particular in our project Secure Cooperative Autonomous systems in relation to the domain of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems. So it is far from easy due to the high complexity of these systems. To preserve the security properties of today's communications against future attacks, protocols must begin to explore the new challenges to design and implement crypto-agility, which has the ability to switch easily from an obsolete cryptographic algorithm to another. To achieve these challenges, we introduce properties for the crypto-agility in order to allow designers to develop generic models, while providing more agility and significantly reducing the development cycle.

The paper introduces the development of the Uranium Resources Technical and Economic Evaluation Expert System (URTEEES) from the viewpoint of requirement analysis, system design, functional structure and application etc. Methods. The system is based on C/B/S mixed mode and applies ASP.NET technology with.Net Framework being selected as the development platform as well as the uranium resources database providing data support at the bottom layer. The paper also proves the efficiency of the system in the context of certain case studies. Findings. Since the system can performs the functions of scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, shareholderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s returns analysis, horizontal comparison of different projects, it can improve the ability of project senior decision-makers for rapid response to the rivals and meet the demand of pricing negotiations.

Technical and economic evaluation model can be set up by users independently according to the current stage of a project (mainly, these are exploration stage, development stage and production stage) as well as according to the selected mining method (e.g. underground mining, surface mining, or in-situ leaching mining). Then, the technical and economic evaluation parameters can be generated. By means of inputting the value of each parameter in a simple and convenient way, the evaluation results can be calculated directly and shown in the form of diagrams; moreover, feasibility evaluation report can be generated automatically, making the process of technical and economic evaluation accurate and efficient.

A QKD system relies on the integration of quantum physical devices, as quantum sources, quantum channels and quantum detectors, in order to generate a true random (unconditionally secure) cryptographic key between two remote parties connected through a quantum channel. The gap between QKD implemented with ideal and real devices can be exploited to attack real systems, unless appropriate countermeasures are implemented. Characterization of real devices and countermeasure is necessary to guarantee security. Free-space QKD systems can provide secure communication to remote parties of the globe, while QKD systems based on entanglement are intrinsically less vulnerable to attack. Metrology to characterize the optical components of these systems is required. Actually, the ""Optical metrology for quantum-enhanced secure telecommunication"" Project (MIQC2) is steering the metrological effort for Quantum Cryptography in the European region in order to accelerate the development and commercial uptake of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technologies. Aim of the project is the development of traceable measurement techniques, apparatus, and protocols that will underpin the characterisation and validation of the performance and quantum-safe security of such systems, essential steps towards standardization and certification of practical implementations of quantum-based technologies.

This technology will become an essential point to secure our communication systems and infrastructure when today's public key cryptography will be broken by either a mathematical algorithm or by, eventually, the development of quantum computers. One of the main task of quantum metrology and standardization in the next future is ensuring that QKD apparatus works as expected, and appropriate countermeasures against quantum hacking are taken. In this paper, we discuss the security of one of the QKD most critical (and quantum-hackered) components, i.e., single photon detectors based on fiber-pigtailed InGaAs SPADs. We analyze their secondary photon emission (backflash light) that can be exploited by an eavesdropper (Eve) to gain information without introducing errors in the key. We observed a significant light leakage from the detection event of fiber-pigtailed InGaAs SPADs. This may represent a significant security threat in all QKD apparatus. We provide a method to quantify the amount of potential information leakage, and we propose a solution to fix this potential security bug in practical QKD apparatus.

Specifically, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) deals with the problem of distributing unconditionally-secure cryptographic keys between two parties. Enabling this technology from space is a critical step for developing a truly-secure global communication network. The National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT, Japan) performed the first successful measurement on the ground of a quantum-limited signal from a satellite in experiments carried out on early August in 2016. The SOTA (Small Optical TrAnsponder) lasercom terminal onboard the LEO satellite SOCRATES (Space Optical Communications Research Advanced Technology Satellite) was utilized for this purpose. Two non-orthogonally polarized signals in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã‚Â¼800-nm band and modulated at 10 MHz were transmitted by SOTA and received in the single-photon regime by using a 1-m Cassegrain telescope on a ground station located in an urban area of Tokyo (Japan). In these experiments, after compensating the Doppler effect induced by the fast motion of the satellite, a QKD-enabling QBER (Quantum Bit Error Rate) below 5% was measured with estimated key rates in the order of several Kbit/s, proving the feasibility of quantum communications in a real scenario from space for the first time.

Also, it provides a survey on the power system applications that have benefited from the powerful QCI as an optimization technique. For each application, technical details that are required for applying QCI, and the most efficient fitness functions are also discussed. In this chapter the definition, categorization and motivation for QCI employment in power systems will be elaborated. The major challenges and hinders for implementation will be discussed. The significance of this study is to present an overview on the applications of QCI in solving various power system problems in electrical engineering, which may be a useful resource for researchers to understand the state of art in QCI application in electric power systems to enable them for further explores.

(2018),2018,Experimental research on application of quantum key in video conference system,International Journal of Online Engineering,10.3991/ijoe.v14i04.8376,"Data transmission in the traditional video conferencing system faces certain security risks currently. Therefore, this study proposed an experimental scheme for the application of quantum key in the traditional video conferencing system. According to this scheme, the quantum gateway was seamlessly embedded into the traditional video conferencing system, based on which the data transmitted through the video conferencing system could be encrypted by the quantum key generated by such quantum gateway. A new quantum key expansion algorithm was put forward because of the relatively low code generation rate of the quantum key of quantum gateway, and the feasibility of the algorithm was verified using the National Institute of Standards and Technology frequency test standard. Quantum keys with different error rates were used to conduct encryption and decryption of three 720p single-screen video images. Moreover, the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the original and decrypted images was calculated. A comparison between these values and theoretical values proved that the quantum key could ensure a normal image quality of the video. This study is of great significance for applying quantum key in the real video conferencing systems and ensuring the security of video data transmission.

(2018),2018,A general guide to applying machine learning to computer architecture,Supercomputing Frontiers and Innovations,10.14529/js?180106,"The resurgence of machine learning since the late 1990s has been enabled by significant advances in computing performance and the growth of big data. The ability of these algorithms to detect complex patterns in data which are extremely difficult to achieve manually, helps to produce effective predictive models. Whilst computer architects have been accelerating the performance of machine learning algorithms with GPUs and custom hardware, there have been few implementations leveraging these algorithms to improve the computer system performance. The work that has been conducted, however, has produced considerably promising results. The purpose of this paper is to serve as a foundational base and guide to future computer architecture research seeking to make use of machine learning models for improving system efficiency. We describe a method that highlights when, why, and how to utilize machine learning models for improving system performance and provide a relevant example showcasing the effectiveness of applying machine learning in computer architecture. We describe a process of data generation every execution quantum and parameter engineering. This is followed by a survey of a set of popular machine learning models. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide an evaluation of implementations for the purpose of creating a workload performance predictor for different core types in an x86 processor. The predictions can then be exploited by a scheduler for heterogeneous processors to improve the system throughput. The algorithms of focus are stochastic gradient descent based linear regression, decision trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbors.

Making use of quantum nondemolition detection gates constructed with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity, our protocol has some attractive advantages. First, the parties can recover less-entangled SPE to be maximally entangled SPE, and reduce photon loss simultaneously. Second, if the protocol fails, the parties can repeat the protocol to reuse some discarded items, which can increase the success probability. Third, when the protocol is successful, they can similarly repeat the protocol to further increase the fidelity of the SPE. Thereby, our protocol provides a possible way to obtain high entanglement, high fidelity and high success probability simultaneously. In particular, our protocol shows higher success probability in the practical high photon loss channel. Based on the above features, our amplification protocol has potential for future application in long-distance quantum communication.

IoT allows smart devices and sensors to sense, connect and control the devices even remotely. The development in the field of Internet of Things has been enormous and the application of these solutions is scalable to high limits. The quantum of Internet of Things (IoT) is developing fast and is predicted to reach each and every sector of the computing world. We are already converging towards smart homes, smart highways, and smart cities. The defense sector of any nation is also affected by these developments. Defense field's solution is primarily based on sensors and their deployments. The primary aim of sensory data is the conclusion of information suitable for tactical decision and analysis in the Future battlefield environment. From capturing soldier's vital health parameters to its weapons, ammunition, location status, every data has a purposeful meaning and is of particular importance to the tactical commander sitting in the command center. We are proposing a novel mechanism to combine Internet of Things with the emerging graph database for better decision support system so as to create a situational awareness about every parameter of the soldiers in the battlefield. We present a simulated use case scenario of the future battlefield to query the graph database for situational awareness pattern for tactical advantage over the opponents.

Different factors engross under various researchers, industries, improving the road transportation system. Major obstacle for vehicle on the road is the junction and traffic clearance at mixed scenarios at the junctions. In this paper, we have proposed a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) architecture for real time traffic information exchange from one traffic signal to another traffic signal via vehicle. A probabilistic function also involved to capture future prediction of traffic count at one step ahead of the current traffic signal. As per the traffic information received time to time a modified Round Robin algorithm is introduced with different and segmented quantum time. In our approach, neither complex computations are required, like image processing nor costly infrastructure is required, like GPS systems and centralized management. In this way we can create a smart, decentralized vehicle transportation system for a mega city.

The secret message can be independently encoded on the photon pairs with 64 unitary operations in all three DOFs. This protocol has a higher capacity than previous QSDC protocols because each photon pair can carry 6 bits of information, not just 2 or 4 bits. Our QSDC protocol decreases the influence of decoherence from environment noise by exploiting the decoy photons to check the security of the transmission of the first photon sequence. Compared with two-way QSDC protocols, our QSDC protocol is immune to an attack by an eavesdropper using Trojan horse attack strategies because it is a one-way quantum communication. The QSDC protocol has good applications in the future quantum communication because of all these features.

Recently, two table-top experiments have demonstrated the principle of QSDC. Here, we report the first long-distance QSDC experiment, including the security test, information encoding, fiber transmission and decoding. After the fiber transmission of 0.5 km, quantum state fidelities of the two polarization entangled Bell states are 91% and 88%, respectively, which are used for information coding. We theoretically analyze the performance of the QSDC system based on current optical communication technologies, showing that QSDC over fiber links of several tens kilometers could be expected.

In recent years, due to the possible applications of quantum communication technologies in military, finance, medicine and other fields, quantum dialogue has been widely concerned. In the year of 2017, NR Zhou et al designed a new quantum dialogue protocol by using the continuous-variable two-mode squeezed vacuum states, where the two communication parties encode their own secret information into the entangled optical modes with the translation operations and each communication party could deduce the secret information of their counterparts with the help of his or her secret information and the Bellbasis measurement results [1]. LH Gong et al devised an efficient three-party quantum dialogue protocol based on the continuous variable GHZ entangled states [2]. NR Zhou et al proposed a secure quantum dialogue protocol based on single-photons, which not only overcomes information leakage but also possesses an acceptable efficiency. M Xiao et al presented a novel quantum dialogue protocol without information leakage over the collective noise channel, where the logical qubits and four-qubit decoherence-free states were introduced to resist against collective-dephasing noise, collective-rotation noise and all kinds of unitary collective noise [4]. T Hwang et al proposed an authenticated quantum dialogue based on Bell states, allowing two communicators to perform mutual authentication and secure bidirectional communications simultaneously via public classical channels [5]. TY Ye proposed a quantum dialogue scheme by employing logical Bell states as the quantum resource to combat the collective-dephasing noise and the collective-rotation noise, which can accomplish the mutual identification and the dialogue between two participants simultaneously and securely over one kind of collective noise channels [6]. M Wang et al proposed a quantum dialogue protocol based on four-qubit entangled state, which is constructed by an EPR pair and two different single qubits through three Controlled-Not gates [7]. By using Bell measurements and the corresponding unitary operations, two users can exchange their messages simultaneously and directly without sharing any secret keys beforehand. The above protocols exploited different quantum states and involved two or three communication parties basically. These protocols cannot satisfy the practical applications of quantum dialogue in future possible quantum communication networks. Therefore, we will propose a multiparty continuous variable quantum dialogue protocol. Multiparty quantum dialogue protocol enables multiple communication parties to transmit and/or receive information at the same time. The protocol could ensure that there is no information leakage in the communication process according to the uncertainty principle and quantum non-cloning theorem.

At the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Everything, demand that innovations in security extend beyond their foundational aspects, to the actual design and deployment of these primitives and protocols while satisfying emerging design constraints such as latency, compactness, energy efficiency, and agility. While many alternatives have been proposed for symmetric key cryptography and related protocols (e.g., lightweight ciphers and authenticated encryption), the alternatives for public key cryptography are limited to post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols. In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising candidate, both in terms of foundational properties, as well as its application to traditional security problems such as key exchange, digital signature, and encryption/decryption. We summarize trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some fundamental recent proposals for the use of lattices in computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs.

(2017),2017,Post-quantum zero-knowledge and signatures from symmetric-key primitives,Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,10.1145/3133956.3133997,"We propose a new class of post-quantum digital signature schemes that: (a) derive their security entirely from the security of symmetric-key primitives, believed to be quantum-secure, and (b) have extremely small keypairs, and, (c) are highly parameterizable. In our signature constructions, the public key is an image y = f (x) of a one-way function f and secret key x. A signature is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of x, that incorporates a message to be signed. For this proof, we leverage recent progress of Giacomelli et al. (USENIX'16) in constructing an efficient ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“-protocol for statements over general circuits. We improve this ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“-protocol to reduce proof sizes by a factor of two, at no additional computational cost. While this is of independent interest as it yields more compact proofs for any circuit, it also decreases our signature sizes. We consider two possibilities to make the proof non-interactive: The Fiat-Shamir transform and Unruh's transform (EUROCRYPT'12, '15,'16). The former has smaller signatures, while the latter has a security analysis in the quantum-accessible random oracle model. By customizing Unruh's transform to our application, the overhead is reduced to 1.6x when compared to the Fiat-Shamir transform, which does not have a rigorous post-quantum security analysis. We implement and benchmark both approaches and explore the possible choice of f , taking advantage of the recent trend to strive for practical symmetric ciphers with a particularly low number of multiplications and end up using LowMC (EUROCRYPT'15).

A novel prototype of an optical modem based on SiPM receivers was realized with support from Osean SAS Co., a French instrumentation company. A number of lab experiments and sea trials in turbid waters and clear open sea were conducted using this modem to evaluate the practical interest of SiPMs. This paper studies the feasibility of using SiPMs for underwater optical communications. It outlines the description of the transmitter and the receiver of the modem prototype, the different techniques used to take advantage of this new technology and solutions to possible practical challenges.

The ease with which a user could interact was the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) of a sales team. Human Computer Interactions have many underlying parameters like Data Visualization and Presentation as some to deal with. With the race, on for better and faster presentations, evolved many frameworks to be widely used by all software developers. As the need grew for user friendly applications, more and more software professionals were lured into the front-end sophistication domain. Application frameworks have evolved to such an extent that with just a few clicks and feeding values as per requirements we are able to produce a commercially usable application in a few minutes. These frameworks generate quantum lines of codes in minutes which leaves a contrail of bugs to be discovered in the future. We have also succumbed to the benchmarking in Software Quality Metrics and have made ourselves comfortable with buggy software's to be rectified in future. The exponential evolution in the cyber domain has also attracted attackers equally. Average human awareness and knowledge has also improved in the cyber domain due to the prolonged exposure to technology for over three decades. As the attack sophistication grows and zero day attacks become more popular than ever, the suffering end users only receive remedial measures in spite of the latest Antivirus, Intrusion Detection and Protection Systems installed. We designed a software to display the complete services and applications running in users Operating System in the easiest perceivable manner aided by Computer Graphics and Data Visualization techniques. We further designed a study by empowering the fence sitter users with tools to actively participate in protecting themselves from threats. The designed threats had impressions from the complete threat canvas in some form or other restricted to systems functioning. Network threats and any sort of packet transfer to and from the system in form of threat was kept out of the scope of this experiment.

Information theoretic security is increasingly important because of the threat of quantum computers that can effectively break algorithms and protocols that are used in today's public key infrastructure. We consider interactive protocols for wiretap II channel with active adversary who can eavesdrop and add adversarial noise to the eavesdropped part of the codeword. These channels capture wireless setting where malicious eavesdroppers at reception distance of the transmitter can eavesdrop the communication and introduce jamming signal to the channel. We derive a new upperbound R ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¤ 1 - ÃƒÂÃ‚Â for the rate of interactive protocols over two-way wiretap II channel with active adversaries, and construct a perfectly secure protocol family with achievable rate 1 - 2ÃƒÂÃ‚Â + ÃƒÂÃ‚Â2. This is strictly higher than the rate of the best one round protocol which is 1 - 2ÃƒÂÃ‚Â, hence showing that interaction improves rate. We also prove that even with interaction, reliable communication is possible only if ÃƒÂÃ‚Â &lt; 1/2.

Transmission line routing is one of the most important strategic decision-making problems for both private and public sectors. The major objective of a utility is to supply demand for power with a good quality of service, through proper planning of the system. This has led to development of methods which can be used to aid the decision-making process for selecting the best alternative. Geographical Information System (GIS)-based electricity transmission system planning strategies are proposed in this article to determine an optimum routing of feeders. Existing and proposed layouts have been drawn using a GIS-based software, Quantum Geographic Information System (Q-GIS). The developed system is based on the routing of transmission lines from Barh thermal power plant situated in Bihar, India.

On the other hand deterministic techniques such as gradient descent exhibit a fast convergence rate around global optimum but may get stuck in a local optimum. Motivated by these problems, a hybrid learning algorithm combining genetic algorithm (GA) with gradient descent (GD), called HGAGD, is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm combines the global exploration ability of GA with the accurate local exploitation ability of GD to achieve a faster convergence and also a better accuracy of final solution. The HGAGD is then used to train a qubit neural network (QNN), which is a good candidate for enhancing the computational efficiency of conventional neural networks, for two different applications. Firstly, a benchmark function is chosen to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in dealing with function approximation problem. Subsequently, the feasibility of the proposed method in designing an indirect adaptive controller for damping of low frequency oscillations in power systems is studied. The results of these studies show that the proposed controller trained by the HGAGD can achieve satisfactory control performance.

However, the variation of reference frames, e.g., polarization and phase reference, would be an acute threat to the performance of MDI systems. Here, based on polarization scrambling units, we demonstrate a reference-frame-independent MDI QKD scheme that is inherently stable against volatile channel conditions; therefore, the final secure key rate will be insensitive to the random disturbances of polarization and the drifts of phase reference. Thus, calibrations of the primary reference frames are intrinsically removed in our scheme, which essentially reduces potential vulnerabilities as well as the resource consumption of the whole system. In addition, a proof-of-principle experiment with an improved fluctuation analysis method is demonstrated to verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed scheme.

The quantum computing theory is applied to tackle some new issues rising from ADP. In details, the unit states in a WUC problem are expressed by the quantum superposition. Then, the collapsing principle of quantum measurement is applied to solve the Bellman equation of ADP speedily. Based on the quantum rotation gate, the pre-decision states of the ADP are generated by quantum amplitude amplification technology. In the proposal algorithm, the quantum computation balances between state space exploration and exploitation automatically. Test cases of WUC are performed to verify the feasibility of the proposal approximate algorithm for the range of 10 to 100 units with 24-hour with ramp rate constraints. The experimental results show that the QI-ADP algorithm can find the sub-optimal solutions of large scale WUC problems within a reasonable time, and the average operational cost is reduced by 9.38% when the wind power is consumed. As a result, it is feasible to use the quantum computing theory to tackle some new issues rising from ADP, and the QI-ADP can be applied to solve large-scale WUC problems.

Here we experimentally demonstrate that polarization quantum states including general qubits of single photon and entangled states can survive well after travelling through seawater. We perform experiments with seawater collected over a range of 36 kilometers in the Yellow Sea. For single photons at 405 nm in a blue-green window, we obtain an average process fidelity above 98%. For entangled photons at 810nm, albeit very high loss, we observe the violation of Bell inequality with 33 standard deviations.

Millimeter-Wave systems have a high available bandwidth and the potential to accommodate numerous antennas in a small area, which makes them an attractive candidate for future networks employing spatial modulation and space-time shift keying (STSK). Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems are capable of achieving an increased throughput, by allowing multiple users to share the same resources at the cost of a higher transmission power, or an increased detection (preprocessing) complexity at the receiver (transmitter) of an uplink (downlink) scenario. In this paper, we propose the new concept of joint-alphabet space time shift keying. As an application scenario, we employ it in the context of the uplink of NOMA mm-Wave systems. We demonstrate with the aid of extrinsic information transfer charts that a higher capacity is achievable when compared with STSK, while retaining the attractive flexibility of STSK in terms of its diversity gain and coding rate. Finally, we conceive quantum-assisted detectors for reducing the detection complexity, while attaining a near-optimal performance, when compared with the optimal iterative maximum A posteriori probability detector.

(2017),2017,An event detection method for social networks based on hybrid link prediction and quantum swarm intelligent,World Wide Web,10.1007/s11280-016-0416-y,"How can we discover and estimate major events in complex social networks? Even with ever enlarging networks and data scale? Event detection and evaluation in social networks provide an effective solution, which has become the critical basis for many real applications, such as crisis management and decision making. The existing event detection methods mainly focus on text analysis that is limited in social media content and graphic feature statistic that needs calculate vast variables. Can we find an efficient way for generalized social networks with limited topology information? In this paper, a novel hybrid quantum swarm intelligence indexing method (HQSII) from the perspective of link prediction is proposed for the first time, which includes an optimal weight algorithm (OWA) and a fluctuation detection algorithm (FDA). The innovations behind HQSII lie in three aspects: (1) The mixed index that can universally describe the social network evolutions is proposed firstly, which explores the cooperation of different independent similarity indexes. OWA is further proposed to determine the optimal mixed index that achieves higher link prediction accuracy and better network evolution description than other independent and mixed similarity indexes. (2) To better avoid the interferences of routine network evolution fluctuations, the otherness of micro node evolutions is considered into link prediction. FDA is further proposed to quantify the abnormal fluctuations caused by events. (3) Based on OWA and FDA, HQSII is proposed for all the generalized social networks, which detects events by discovering abnormal fluctuations and evaluates events by analyzing fluctuation trends. Extensive experiments on theoretical and real-world social networks show that HQSII can accurately detect events and quantitatively evaluate event impacts in social networks with single and multiple events.

The paper introduces the structure of the energy measurement data system and analyzes the current situation and application demands for the system at home and abroad. It focuses on the basic and forward-looking technologies necessary for future energy measurement development, such as the new-generation cryptographic technology, private information protection in energy information network environments, the distribution and application mode of quantum key, secure communication protocol, big data access control, information sharing and fusion, and mass data processing, analyzing and application.

The main reason lies in the quantum leap of capacity it provides with respect to wireless networks operating in the sub 6-GHz band. Nevertheless, efficient and reliable communication in this band demands novel techniques to tackle all the associated barriers related to wireless propagation in those bands. In this paper, we present the extension of our ns-3 IEEE 802.11ad model and provide design and implementation details of the new techniques, including dynamic and static channel access schemes, decentralized clustering, beamformed link maintenance, spatial sharing, and half-duplex relay operation as defined in the IEEE 802.11ad amendment.

A plausible option maybe a return to the future via Morse code using how a quantum bit (Qubit) reacts when entangled to suggest a cypher. This quantum cyphers uses multiple properties of unique entities that have many random radicals which makes hacking more difficult that traditional 'Rivest-Shamir-Adleman' (RSA), 'Digital Signature Algorithm' (DSA) or 'Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm' (ECDSA). Additional security is likely by Backchannelling (slipstreaming) Quantum Morse code (Q-Morse) keys composed of living and non-living entities. This means Blockchain ledger history (forwards - backwards) is audited during an active session. Verification keys are Backchannelling (slipstreaming) during the session (e.g. train driver must incrementally activate a switch otherwise the train stops) using predicted - expected sender - receiver properties as well as their past history of disconformities to random radicals encountered. In summary, Quantum Morse code (Q-Morse) plausibly is the enabler to additional security by Backchannelling (slipstreaming) during a communications session.

An efficient error correction algorithm, Turbo Code, is employed. Compared with the current error correction algorithm of Cascade, a high-efficiency error correction is realized by Turbo Code with only one-time data exchange. For a low QBER, with only one-time data exchange, the final key rates based on Turbo code are similar with Cascade. As the QBER increases, Turbo Code gives higher final key rates than Cascade. Our results experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of satellite-ground QKD and show that the efficient error correction based on Turbo Code is potentially useful for the satellite-ground quantum communication.

We then describe specialized libraries that have been developed using the LIQUi| programming language. This includes reversible circuits for arithmetic as well as new, truly quantum approaches that rely on quantum computer architectures that allow the probabilistic execution of gates, a model that can reduce time and space overheads in some cases. We highlight why these libraries are useful for the implementation of many quantum algorithms. Finally, we survey the tool Revs that facilitate resource efficient compilation of higher-level irreversible programs into lower-level reversible circuits while trying to optimize the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks.

With large-scale wind power connected into the power grid, power forecast errors increase in the day-ahead market which lowers the economic efficiency of the separate trading scheme. This paper proposes a robust unified trading model that includes the forecasts of real-time prices and imbalance power into the day-ahead trading scheme. The model is developed based on robust optimization in view of the undefined probability distribution of clearing prices of the real-time market. For the model to be used efficiently, an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm algorithm (IQPSO) is presented in the paper based on an in-depth analysis of the limitations of the static character of quantum-behaved particle swarm algorithm (QPSO).

The FNN optimization is often viewed from the various perspectives: the optimization of weights, network architecture, activation nodes, learning parameters, learning environment, etc. Researchers adopted such different viewpoints mainly to improve the FNN's generalization ability. The gradient-descent algorithm such as backpropagation has been widely applied to optimize the FNNs. Its success is evident from the FNN's application to numerous real-world problems. However, due to the limitations of the gradient-based optimization methods, the metaheuristic algorithms including the evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, etc., are still being widely explored by the researchers aiming to obtain generalized FNN for a given problem. This article attempts to summarize a broad spectrum of FNN optimization methodologies including conventional and metaheuristic approaches. This article also tries to connect various research directions emerged out of the FNN optimization practices, such as evolving neural network (NN), cooperative coevolution NN, complex-valued NN, deep learning, extreme learning machine, quantum NN, etc. Additionally, it provides interesting research challenges for future research to cope-up with the present information processing era.

It is generally envisioned that in future quantum networks, separated nodes containing stationary solid-state or atomic qubits are connected via the exchange of optical photons over large distances. In this work, we explore an intriguing alternative for quantum communication via all-microwave networks. To make this possible, we describe a general protocol for sending quantum states through thermal channels, even when the number of thermal photons in the channel is much larger than 1. The protocol can be implemented with state-of-the-art superconducting circuits and enables the transfer of quantum states over distances of about 100 m via microwave transmission lines cooled to only T = 4 K. This opens up new possibilities for quantum communication within and across buildings and, consequently, for the implementation of intracity quantum networks based on microwave technology only.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084817298&doi=10.1109%2fICSOS45490.2019.8978990&partnerID=40&md5=ad88e7d41e561e38198bbdf6c012295c,Conference Paper,6,0.82933265,0,0.433054869,0,0,0,0,0.137361595,0,0,0,0.058549483,0,0,0.090390091,0,0,0,0.050832104,0,0,0.194385506,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046847027,0,0,0,0.19190262,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.170470157,0,0,0,0,0,0.33980003,0,0.143925033,0,0,0.33092938,0,0.157201661,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.231355389,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.069002793,0,0,0.451695622,0,0,0.177988506,0,0,0,0,0.175461394,0,0,0,0,0.133490432,0,0,0.1751665,0,0,0,0,0.17278763,3.932597822,0.544059184

Quantum Computing comes to rescue by offering a lot of promises in information processing systems, particularly in Big Data Analytics. In this paper, we have reviewed the available literature on Big Data Analytics using Quantum Computing for Machine Learning and its current state of the art. We categorized the Quantum Machine learning in different subfields depending upon the logic of their learning followed by a review in each technique. Quantum Walks used to construct Quantum Artificial Neural Networks, which exponentially speed-up the quantum machine learning algorithm is discussed. Quantum Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning and its benefits are compared with that of Classical counterpart. The limitations of some of the existing Machine learning techniques and tools are enunciated, and the significance of Quantum computing in Big Data Analytics is incorporated.

Numerous experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of quantum cryptography and a complete proof of the unconditional security of some main schemes. However, in practice all devices need trusting by each other firstly during the process of quantum key distribution(QKD). For identifying the reliability, we propose a quantum bit commitment protocol that can be regarded as the primitive of authentication protocol in QKD networks. In this protocol we complete bit commitment merely by one agent, and prove the security of the schemes. Compared with other protocols, our schemes have less requirement for additional hardware and lower complexity in implementation.

We report a complete strategy: starting with an algorithm in the form of a quantum computer program, we compile it into a high-level logical circuit that goes through multiple stages of decomposition into progressively lower-level circuits until we reach the physical execution-level specification. We skip the fault-tolerance layer, as it is not within the scope of this work. The different stages are structured so as to best assist with the overall optimization while taking into account numerous optimization criteria, including minimizing the number of expensive two-qubit gates, minimizing the number of less expensive single-qubit gates, optimizing the runtime, minimizing the overall circuit error, and optimizing classical control sequences. Our approach allows a trade-off between circuit runtime and quantum error, as well as to accommodate future changes in the optimization criteria that may likely arise as a result of the anticipated improvements in the physical-level control of the experiment.

In light of the random selection of cluster head in low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol algorithm, the residual energy of nodes, node location and node density are not considered. Through theoretical deduction and mathematical calculation, the study found that it is a NP - hard problem. A swarm intelligence algorithm was introduced into the clustering algorithm of wireless sensor network, and an efficient and reliable clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based on quantum artificial bee colony algorithm was proposed. Considering the residual energy of nodes, node location and node density, and the energy consumption of the network is balanced. Experiments show that the proposed routing protocol outperforms other work in most cases by reducing the network energy consumption for WSNs by more than 13%, which indicates the feasibility of the authors' approach for efficient and reliable routing protocol in wireless sensor networks.

Our central thesis is that various versions of Moore's Laws will all unavoidably break down over the next two to three decades, due to fundamental limitations imposed by the laws of physics (especially quantum mechanics). Therefore, the end to scaling-up von Neumann-based architectures by adding more cores and other incremental technology advancements is within sight. How are these challenges to be overcome, in order to continue making computation faster, cheaper, more energy efficient and more reliable? One possible answer lies in connectionist massively parallel models, based on (artificial) neural networks and other paradigms from biology, neuroscience and statistical physics. We discuss what would such massively parallel connectionist computers be like if they were to be based on 'implementing neural networks in the hardware', and undertake several thought experiments comparing and contrasting the hypothetical connectionist parallel machines with the 'classical' multicore supercomputers and large-scale distributed computing systems.

Wavelength-division multiplexing between QKD and classical optical communications by sharing the existing fiber-optics infrastructure is highly desired in order to reduce the cost of QKD applications. However, comparing to the light for classical transmission, quantum signals are very weak and easily affected by impairments from classical light, such as the spontaneous Raman-scattering effect. Here, by selecting an optimal wavelength of quantum signals, we significantly reduce the influence of the Raman-scattering effect. In addition, through coherent optical communication technology, we achieve high-speed classical data transmission with relatively low launch powers, thereby further reducing the impairments from classical light. As a result, we realize the multiplexing and long-distance copropagation of QKD and terabit classical data transmission up to 80 km. The data capacity is two orders of magnitude larger than the existing results. Our demonstration verifies the feasibility of QKD and classical communication to share the resources of backbone fiber links and thus taking the utility of QKD a great step forward.

(2017),2017,On the application of advanced commercial off the shelf technology in future flexible high capacity payloads,Ka and Broadband Communications Conference,,"Geostationary satellite primes are actively engaged in the development of generic and flexible high throughput satellites. These satellites must be capable of delivering the traditional benefits of GEO i.e. reach or wide coverage with a lower cost per bit than the emerging constellations. Many solutions resolve around active arrays based on GaN SSPA with high capacity digital beam-formers. To enable this vision the cost, mass, and DC power per digitally processed bit must take a quantum step forward compared with historical solutions deployed in L band mobile missions. It is likely that this can only be achieved by taking benefit of the rapid progress of the terrestrial semi-conductor market where 10nm technology is now allowing mobile phones to deliver laptop beating processing power. This paper will discuss different types of communications links and the corresponding payload architecture under development to support these links. The paper will reflect these broad payload design drivers into high-level requirements for the next generation of digital processor.

Globally all country has been striving to address on many research aspects by which we can sustain this resources considering various aspects such as quality, optimization, maintenance etc. In order to ensure the availability of sufficient water, it becomes almost imperative in a modern society, to plan and design sustainable water distribution network (WDN) to the various section of the community in accordance with their requirements and demands.This study combines application of Geographic Information System(GIS) as a framework for managing and integrating data by Quantum GIS i.e(QGIS) with mainly three hydraulic plugins i.e.Ghydraulics, Open layer and Qgis2threejs.Ghydraulics allows to analysis WDN with Epanet, open layer with open street maps whereas Qgis2threejs plugin helps in exporting terrain data, mapping canvas image and vector data to the web browser and later analyzing through hydraulic simulation in EPANET. The main challenge faced is the decisions to ensure delivery of water to several locations with optimally sized, and compatible with existing infrastructure considering the demand and supply.The application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is to visualize, and simulate entire WDN from source to household and creating a technology with considerable potential for achieving remarkable gains in efficiency and productivity. Generally, the planning of the pipeline grid is carried out using Survey of India toposheets and preliminary ground survey which are demanding and time-consuming.In this research, use of remote sensing via spatial data, along with digital elevation model (DEM) is carried out for assessment of pipeline grids. DEM generated are used to understand the possible topographic profile which indicates the possible routes of gravity flow and outlines a procedure for pre-feasibility analysis and least pipe network could be laid thus optimizing the project considering all above-said parameters.

If a high percentage of the optical pulses are comprised of single photons, then the statistical nature of light and information theory can be used to generate secure shared random bit strings which can then be converted to keys for encryption systems. When these keys are incorporated along with symmetric encryption techniques such as a one-Time pad, then this method of key generation and encryption is resistant to future advances in quantum computing which will significantly degrade the effectiveness of current asymmetric key sharing techniques. This research first reviews the transition of Quantum Key Distribution free-space experiments from the laboratory environment to field experiments, and finally, ongoing space experiments. Next, a propagation model for an optical pulse from low-earth orbit to ground and the effects of turbulence on the transmitted optical pulse is described. An Adaptive Optics system is modeled to correct for the aberrations caused by the atmosphere. The long-Term point spread function of the completed low-earth orbit to ground optical system is explored in the results section. Finally, the impact of this optical system and its point spread function on an overall quantum key distribution system as well as the future work necessary to show this impact is described.

A global quantum key distribution (QKD) network can play a role in computational attack-resistant encryption. Such a network could use a constellation of high altitude platforms such as airships and satellites as trusted nodes to facilitate QKD between any two points on the globe on demand. This requires both space-To-ground and inter-platform links. However, the prohibitive cost of traditional satellite based development limits the experimental work demonstrating relevant technologies. To accelerate progress towards a global network, we use an emerging class of shoe-box sized spacecraft known as CubeSats. We have designed a polarization entangled photon pair source that can operate on board CubeSats. The robustness and miniature form factor of our entanglement source makes it especially suitable for performing pathfinder missions that studies QKD between two high altitude platforms. The technological outcomes of such mission would be the essential building blocks for a global QKD network. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The intermittency and uncertainty of wind power may pose danger on the safety of the power system, thus Research of short-term load forecasting has important practical application value in the field of power network dispatching. The keys of wind power forecasting are the forecasting model selection and model optimization. In this paper, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is chosen as the wind speed and the wind power prediction model and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to optimize the most important parameters which influence the least squares support vector machine regression model. In the proposed QPSO-LSSVM, the kernel parameter ÃƒÂÃ†â€™ and regularization parameter ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â³ are considered as the position vector of particles and quantum mechanics is introduced in particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to effectively solve the contradiction between expanding search and finding optimal solution. A multiinput-multi-output (MIMO) short-term prediction model is built and applied in a wind farm of Gansu province in order to predict wind speed and wind power. For comparative study, PSO-LSSVM model and SVM model are used for forecasting, meanwhile, several error indicators are selected to analyze the results of the three models. Prediction analysis results show that the QPSO-LSSVM model can achieve higher prediction accuracy and confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.

We implement the quantum communication protocol BB84, in a waveguide based circuit using integrated optics. We also propose a high dimensional quantum key distribution method implementation using integrated optics. In the earlier one polarized photons are used as the carriers of quantum information, while in second one electromagnetic modes in the waveguide are used to carry quantum information. The high dimensional quantum communication method is used to increase the information content of protocol thus increasing on the data rates. This is done by encoding into a larger state space. We have used electromagnetic modes for encoding since the polarization method is not efficient to carry information in a larger state space.

In order to mitigate the experimental complexity of MDI-QCC and remove the key assumption (the sources are trusted) in MDI-QCC, we extend the framework of MDI-QKD with an untrusted source to MDI-QCC and give the rigorous security analysis of MDI-QCC with an untrusted source. What is more, in the security analysis we clearly provide a rigorous analytical method for parameters estimation, which with simple modifications can be applied to not only MDI-QKD with an untrusted source but also arbitrary multi-party communication protocol with an untrusted source. The simulation results show that at reasonable distances the asymptotic key rates for the two cases (with trusted and untrusted sources) almost overlap, which indicates the feasibility of our protocol.

However, due to the non-stationary of traffic flow data, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, so probabilistic forecasting methods are essential for quantification of the potential uncertainties and risks for traffic management. This paper proposes a kernel extreme learning machine (KELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method of traffic flow, and the parameters of KELM are optimized by using Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. To verify its effectiveness, traffic flow prediction using QPSO-KELM are compared with other methods. Experimental results show that QPSO-KELM has higher prediction accuracy at different confidence levels for practical applications in traffic management systems. And it will help traffic managers to make right decisions.

However, the assumption on the characterizations of encoding states is still necessary in this promising protocol, which may lead to unnecessary complexity and potential loopholes in realistic implementations. Here, by using the mismatched-basis statistics, we present the first proof-of-principle experiment of MDI QKD with uncharacterized encoding sources. In this demonstration, the encoded states are only required to be constrained in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, and two distant parties (Alice and Bob) are resistant to state preparation flaws even if they have no idea about the detailed information of their encoding states. The positive final secure key rates of our system exhibit the feasibility of this novel protocol, and demonstrate its value for the application of secure communication with uncharacterized devices.

It has been long known that secure Quantum Oblivious Transfer can be achieved from a secure implementation of Quantum Bit Commitment. Unfortunately, it is also well known that unconditionally secure Quantum Bit Commitment is impossible, so building a secure Oblivious Transfer protocol on top of Quantum Bit Commitment is ruled out. In this paper, we propose a relatively simple quantum protocol for Oblivious Transfer which does not require qubit storage, does not rely on bit commitment as a primitive and is easily implementable with current technology, if the two actors are honest. The protocol is proven to be secure against any individual measurements and entanglement-based attacks. Any cheating attempt trying to speculate collective measurements would be considerably difficult to put in practice, even in the near future. Furthermore, the number of qubits used in our scheme (embodied as photons in a physical realization of the protocol) acts as a security parameter, making it increasingly hard to cheat.

Dedicated devices are commonly required to implement QKD. In this paper, we propose a scheme which allows classical communication and QKD to be implemented simultaneously using the same communication infrastructure. More specially, we propose a coherent communication scheme where both the bits for classical communication and the Gaussian distributed random numbers for QKD are encoded on the same weak coherent pulse and decoded by the same coherent receiver. Simulation results based on practical system parameters show that both deterministic classical communication with a bit error rate of 10-9 and secure key distribution could be achieved over tens of kilometers of single-mode fibers. It is conceivable that in the future coherent optical communication network, QKD will be operated in the background of classical communication at a minimal cost.

Spintronics has infiltrated almost every household in the form of the read head sensors for the hard drives that inhabit every desktop and most laptop computers. Embedded magnetic random access memory (MRAM) and in-plane STT-RAM are rapidly replacing SRAM in a host of applications that do not require ultra-dense memories. Soon these embedded spintronic memories will permeate the cell phone market because they are much denser than SRAM, offer lower power at only slightly lower speed and are non-volatile. The present work in spintronics at most of the mainstream semiconductor companies and foundaries is focused on the development of perpendicular STT-MRAM, as a universal memory that can compete with the mainstream memories and surpass them in several key metrics. Several innovative ideas are presented where spintronics may have an impact because of the uniqueness of the approach. Nanomagnetic logic and storage may offer extremely high densities at very low power. Spin-torque oscillators are a very novel approach to pattern recognition that may be relevant for handling massive data sets. The spin of the electron may also be on the critical path for quantum computation or communication, another revolutionary change in how we process information.

699,3,C3,Verbanis et al. (2016),2016,24-Hour Relativistic Bit Commitment,Physical Review Letters,10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.140506,"Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive in which a party wishes to commit a secret bit to another party. Perfect security between mistrustful parties is unfortunately impossible to achieve through the asynchronous exchange of classical and quantum messages. Perfect security can nonetheless be achieved if each party splits into two agents exchanging classical information at times and locations satisfying strict relativistic constraints. A relativistic multiround protocol to achieve this was previously proposed and used to implement a 2-millisecond commitment time. Much longer durations were initially thought to be insecure, but recent theoretical progress showed that this is not so. In this Letter, we report on the implementation of a 24-hour bit commitment solely based on timed high-speed optical communication and fast data processing, with all agents located within the city of Geneva. This duration is more than 6 orders of magnitude longer than before, and we argue that it could be extended to one year and allow much more flexibility on the locations of the agents. Our implementation offers a practical and viable solution for use in applications such as digital signatures, secure voting and honesty-preserving auctions.

700,1,C5,Affinito & Cavazzoni (2016),2016,FFT data distribution in plane-waves DFT codes. A case study from Quantum ESPRESSO,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,10.1145/2966884.2966892,"Density Functional Theory calculations with plane waves and pseudopotentials represent one of the most important simulation techniques in high performance computing. Together with parallel linear algebra (ZGEMM and matrix diagonalization), the most important bottleneck results from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), required, for example, when the local potential is applied to the wavefunction. In these calculations, the existence of a cutoff on the plane waves is reflected on a spherical domain for the FFT. After a 1D FFT is performed on pencils distributed among processors, data is transposed with a MPI Alltoall and a 2D FFT is executed [2]. Typically, the workload of the FFT is not particularly high, since grid sizes do not exceed (103 102)3. However, the load distribution is crucial and the consequent impact of collective communications becomes a critical factor for achieving a high parallel efficiency. Quantum ESPRESSO [3] is one of the most used codes based on plane-wave DFT in the community of material science. It has been successfully ported and optimized on a large number of HPC infrastructures all over the world. The parallel structure of Quantum ESPRESSO is mainly based on several layers of MPI communicators, plus a finer grain OpenMP parallelization. Recently, the parallelization structure of the FFT was deeply refactored. The combination of two different data distributions, i.e. bands and taskgroups, allow the underlyinghardware to be hierarchically filled and two different layers of communications to be tuned. In particular, with sufficient memory, by tuning the number of taskgroups one can fit all the data required to perform a single 3D FFT reducing the impact of the MPI Alltoall between the 1D and 2D FFTs. In order to better check the results of the parametrization of the parallel distributions, a miniapp [1] containing only the FFT kernel was extracted from the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution. This miniapp is also important for the future activity of code design of novel architectures. We present and discuss the profiling data obtained from the QE-FFT miniapp and the impact on the communication pattern deriving from the choice of the parallelization parameters.

(2016),2016,Continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on a plug-and-play dual-phase-modulated coherent-states protocol,Physical Review A,10.1103/PhysRevA.94.032305,"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol using dual-phase-modulated coherent states. We show that the modulation scheme of our protocol works equivalently to that of the Gaussian-modulated coherent-states (GMCS) protocol, but shows better experimental feasibility in the plug-and-play configuration. Besides, it waives the necessity of propagation of a local oscillator (LO) between legitimate users and generates a real local LO for quantum measurement. Our protocol is proposed independent of the one-way GMCS QKD without sending a LO [Opt. Lett. 40, 3695 (2015)10.1364/OL.40.003695; Phys. Rev. X 5, 041009 (2015)10.1103/PhysRevX.5.041009; Phys. Rev. X 5, 041010 (2015)10.1103/PhysRevX.5.041010]. In those recent works, the system stability will suffer the impact of polarization drifts induced by environmental perturbations, and two independent frequency-locked laser sources are necessary to achieve reliable coherent detection. In the proposed protocol, these previous problems can be resolved. We derive the security bounds for our protocol against collective attacks, and we also perform a proof-of-principle experiment to confirm the utility of our proposal in real-life applications. Such an efficient scheme provides a way of removing the security loopholes associated with the transmitting LO, which have been a notoriously hard problem in continuous-variable quantum communication.

Over 100 different types of these methods are discussed in detail. The authors emphasize non-standard optimization problems and utilize a natural approach to the topic, moving from basic notions to more complex ones. An introductory chapter covers the necessary biological and mathematical backgrounds for understanding the main material. Subsequent chapters then explore almost all of the major metaheuristics for search and optimization created based on natural phenomena, including simulated annealing, recurrent neural networks, genetic algorithms and genetic programming, differential evolution, memetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, artificial immune systems, ant colony optimization, tabu search and scatter search, bee and bacteria foraging algorithms, harmony search, biomolecular computing, quantum computing, and many others. General topics on dynamic, multimodal, constrained, and multiobjective optimizations are also described. Each chapter includes detailed flowcharts that illustrate specific algorithms and exercises that reinforce important topics. Introduced in the appendix are some benchmarks for the evaluation of metaheuristics. Search and Optimization by Metaheuristics is intended primarily as a textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students specializing in engineering and computer science. It will also serve as a valuable resource for scientists and researchers working in these areas, as well as those who are interested in search and optimization methods.

Our scheme is extremely cost-effective and efficient in terms of resources as it employs only one source of entangled photons and one fixed unbalanced interferometer per phase-coded analysis basis. We show that the maximum analysis spectral bandwidth is obtained when the analysis interferometers are properly unbalanced, a strategy which can be straightforwardly applied to most of today's experiments based on energy-time and time-bin entanglement. Our scheme has therefore a great potential for boosting bit rates and reducing the resource overhead of future entanglement-based quantum key distribution systems.

(2016),2016,Increased certification of semi-device independent random numbers using many inputs and more post-processing,New Journal of Physics,10.1088/1367-2630/18/6/065004,"Quantum communication with systems of dimension larger than two provides advantages in information processing tasks. Examples include higher rates of key distribution and random number generation. The main disadvantage of using such multi-dimensional quantum systems is the increased complexity of the experimental setup. Here, we analyze a not-so-obvious problem: the relation between randomness certification and computational requirements of the post-processing of experimental data. In particular, we consider semi-device independent randomness certification from an experiment using a four dimensional quantum system to violate the classical bound of a random access code. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a smaller quantum violation requires more computational power to demonstrate randomness, which at some point becomes impossible with today's computers although the randomness is (probably) still there. We show that by dedicating more input settings of the experiment to randomness certification, then by more computational postprocessing of the experimental data which corresponds to a quantum violation, one may increase the amount of certified randomness. Furthermore, we introduce a method that significantly lowers the computational complexity of randomness certification. Our results show how more randomness can be generated without altering the hardware and indicate a path for future semi-device independent protocols to follow.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the asymmetric key algorithms, beginning from the inception of asymmetric cryptography in 1976 till the present day. This paper provides a description of their encryption and decryption operations, points out their security basis, areas of implementation, their strengths and weaknesses during operation. Finally, the paper pinpoints the existing gap based on conclusions drawn from the review, with particular emphasis on an algorithm most suited for industrial application given the current trends in cryptography towards quantum computing. This paper then narrows down on the earnest need for an algorithm that has no trade-off in encryption and decryption speeds, has low computation overhead and is secure enough to withstand quantum algorithm attacks.

Recent developments in quantum measurement theory have offered new alternatives to approach some of the most remarkable problems in quantum physics. Consequently, the principles of quantum mechanics have been exploited in the development of quantum technologies such as optical metrology, quantum communication, and quantum information. In recent years, weak measurements and two of its most remarkable variants: weak value amplification and direct measurement, have been developed and are considered important resources for quantum applications. In this paper, we discuss weak measurements and some significant applications of weak values. We elaborate on how distinct forms of weak values are used to observe and amplify small effects or to directly measure the quantum wave function of photons, a crucial task for schemes for quantum communication and quantum information. We also review some of the most recent methods for weak value amplification and direct measurement that our group has developed. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2016 by Societa Italiana di Fisica.

The project will focus on the remarkably versatile field of Lattice-based cryptography as the source of computational hardness, and will deliver optimised public key security primitives for digital signatures and authentication, as well identity based encryption (IBE) and attribute based encryption (ABE). This will involve algorithmic and design optimisations, and implementations of lattice-based cryptographic schemes addressing cost, energy consumption, performance and physical robustness. As the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) prepares for the transition to a post-quantum cryptographic suite B, urging organisations that build systems and infrastructures that require longterm security to consider this transition in architectural designs; the SAFEcrypto project will provide Proof-of-concept demonstrators of schemes for three practical real-world case studies with long-Term security requirements, in the application areas of satellite communications, network security and cloud. The goal is to afirm Lattice-based cryptography as an effective replacement for traditional number-Theoretic public-key cryptography, by demonstrating that it can address the needs of resource-constrained embedded applications, such as mobile and battery-operated devices, and of real-Time high performance applications for cloud and network management infrastructures.

However, practical QKD suffers from a number of quantum hackings due to the device imperfections. From the security standpoint, measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is in the limelight since it eliminates all the possible loopholes in detection. Due to active control units for mode matching between the photons from remote parties, however, the implementation of MDI-QKD is highly impractical. In this paper, we propose a method to resolve the mode matching problem while minimizing the use of active control units. By introducing the plug-and-play (P&P) concept into MDI-QKD, the indistinguishability in spectral and polarization modes between photons can naturally be guaranteed. We show the feasibility of P&P MDI-QKD with a proof-of-principle experiment.

When these channels are lossy and noisy, it is often impossible to directly transmit quantum states between two distant parties. We use a new technique called superdense teleportation to communicate quantum information deterministically with greatly reduced resources, simplified measurements, and decreased classical communication cost. These advantages make this technique ideal for communicating quantum information for space applications. We are currently implementing an superdense teleportation lab demonstration, using photons hyperentangled in polarization and temporal mode to communicate a special set of two-qubit, single-photon states between two remote parties. A slight modification of the system readily allows it to be used to implement quantum cryptography as well. We investigate the possibility of implementation from an Earth's orbit to ground.

This paper presents the design and simulation of a 16-bit ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 32 -bit SRAM with a new structure in QCA. Since QCA is a pipeline, this SRAM has a high operating speed.

However, with rapidly developing technology, the available encryption techniques are becoming more prone to attack every day. Focusing this issue, in this paper, we propose a new technique of encryption that will enhance the security level by a significant margin with the help of quantum computing. Additionally, our proposed technique also enhances data transmission rate through exploiting the notion of Superdense Coding. Such simultaneous improvement in both security level and data transmission rate, which we achieve through our proposed technique, is a rare trait for currently available encryption technique. We name our proposed technique SuperCrypt. We elaborate implementation issues pertinent for SuperCrypt such as recycling qubits and re-establishing entanglement. We also implement SuperCrypt in a discrete-event network simulator ns-2 and evaluate the performance of SuperCrypt through analyzing the simulation results.

The objective function minimizes the total power consumption and the constraint conditions include the requirement of the system outage probability and the feasibility of the subcarrier allocation solution. In order to solve the above chance-constrained resource allocation problem, two steps are taken to develop hybrid quantum particle swarm optimization (HQPSO). In the first step, we define an uncertain function according to the outage probability constraint condition and utilize the radial basis function (BRF) neural network to computer it. In the second step, HQPSO which includes quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and RBF neural network is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the total power consumption of HQPSO is smaller than that of other algorithms while the system outage probability could be satisfied very well.

Present capabilities and capacities of Indian Space are mainly in the unitary system of the national space agency - this has enabled the nation to achieve about 6-8 high-quality domestic missions annually. Meeting future domestic needs AND accessing large global market of space will require a quantum jump in Indian capabilities and capacities. Another aspect is growth and aspirations of Indian economy - GDP growth around 7-8 In an earlier study, we have outlined the future 10-20 years of policy perspectives for Indian Space and also outlined the perspectives of a National Space Eco-system of a ""public-private-academia triad"". We now envisage critical developments that will bring impacting and paradigm shifts to Indian Space through the ""triad"" - Game Changers. With about 100-150 possible missions in coming 10-20 years - encompassing EO, satellite communications, positioning, space science, planetary missions, launch missions and the initiation of a human space flight programme, the ""critical shifts"" would be not just technological advancements but more towards organizational re-structuring from emerging newer organizational arrangements, industrialization and emergence of private space industry, deeper penetration of space services in Indian society, increasing global presence of Indian players and a vibrant collaboration at international level. What will drive these game-changers? Cost efficiency will be one key - amply demonstrated by India in many global sectors, this will impact not just national BUT global space markets and bring a ""levelling effect"". Indian human resources skills will be another driver - Indian scientists, engineers and managers will play a larger role in national and global space. Third will be ""Indian innovation"" (called ""jugaad"") - ability to improvise and innovate with simple, low-cost BUT effective solutions. These will bring a new economic model that balances systems, costs and performance.

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using entangled photons is a promising approach. A global QKD network can be achieved using satellites equipped with optical links. Despite numerous proposals, actual experimental work demonstrating relevant entanglement technology in space is limited due to the prohibitive cost of traditional satellite development. To make progress, we have designed a photon pair source that can operate on modular spacecraft called CubeSats. We report the in-orbit operation of the photon pair source on board an orbiting CubeSat and demonstrate pair generation and polarisation correlation under space conditions. The in-orbit polarisation correlations are compatible with ground-based tests, validating our design. This successful demonstration is a major experimental milestone towards a space-based quantum network. Our approach provides a cost-effective method for proving the space-worthiness of critical components used in entangled photon technology. We expect that it will also accelerate efforts to probe the overlap between quantum and relativistic models of physics.

Such constructions are extensively used in financial applications such as Bitcoins, where more than one key is required in order to authorize Bitcoin transactions. However, many of the current stateof- the-art multisignature schemes are based on the RSA or discrete-log assumptions, which may become insecure in the future, for example due to the possibility of quantum attacks. In this paper we propose a new multisignature scheme that is built on top of the intractability of lattice problems that remain hard to solve even in presence of powerful quantum computers. The size of a multisignature is quasi optimal and our scheme can also easily be transformed into a more general aggregate signature scheme. Finally, we give an efficient implementation of the scheme which testifies its practicality and competitive capacity.

Such a network would require the implementation of quantum teleportation between remote parties. However, for photonic Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«quditsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» of dimension greater than two, this teleportation always fails due to the inability to carry out the required quantum Bell-state measurement. A quantum communication protocol called Superdense Teleportation (SDT) can allow the reconstruction of a state without the usual 2-photon Bell-state measurements, enabling the protocol to succeed deterministically even for high dimensional qudits. This technique restricts the class of states transferred to equimodular states, a type of superposition state where each term can differ from the others in phase but not in amplitude; this restricted space of transmitted states allows the transfer to occur deterministically. We report on our implementation of SDT using photon pairs that are entangled in both polarization and temporal mode. After encoding the phases of the desired equimodular state on the signal photon, we perform a complete tomography on the idler photon to verify that we properly prepared the chosen state. Beyond our tabletop demonstration, we are working towards an implementation between a space platform in low earth orbit and a ground telescope, to demonstrate the feasibility of space-based quantum communication. We will discuss the various challenges presented by moving the experiment out of the laboratory, and our proposed solutions to make Superdense Teleportation realizable in the space setting.

(2015),2015,Teleportation of entanglement over 143 km,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.1517007112,"As a direct consequence of the no-cloning theorem, the deterministic amplification as in classical communication is impossible for unknown quantum states. This calls for more advanced techniques in a future global quantum network, e.g., for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation of an entangled state, i.e., entanglement swapping, representing the central resource to relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater. Since the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in realworld scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a freespace entanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 SDs beyond the classical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the independence of the nodes is highly demanded.

This paper presents a practical data management model in a public and private multi-cloud environment. The proposed model BFT-MCDB incorporates Shamir's Secret Sharing approach and Quantum Byzantine Agreement protocol to improve trustworthiness and security of business data storage, without compromising performance. The performance evaluation is carried out using a cloud computing simulator called CloudSim. The experimental results show significantly better performance in terms of data storage and data retrieval compared to other common cloud cryptographic based models.

The building of practical, general purpose Quantum Computers may be some years into the future. However, Quantum Communication and Quantum Cryptography are well developed. Commercial Quantum Key Distribution systems are easily available and several QKD networks have been built in various parts of the world. The security of the protocols used in these implementations rely on information-theoretic proofs, which may or may not reflect actual system behaviour. Moreover, testing of implementations cannot guarantee the absence of bugs and errors. This paper presents a novel framework for modelling and verifying quantum protocols and their implementations using the proof assistant Coq. We provide a Coq library for quantum bits (qubits), quantum gates, and quantum measurement.

Hash-based, code-based, lattice-based, multivariate-quadratic-equations, and secret-key cryptography are all potential candidates, the merit of which is that they are believed to resist both classical and quantum computers and applying ""Shor's algorithm"" - the quantum-computer discrete-logarithm algorithm that breaks classical schemes - to them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose reliable and error detection hash trees for stateless hash-based signatures which are believed to be one of the prominent post-quantum schemes, offering security proofs relative to plausible properties of the hash function. We note that this work on the emerging area of reliable, error detection post-quantum cryptography, can be extended and scaled to other approaches as well. We also note that the proposed approaches make such schemes more reliable against natural faults and help protecting them against malicious faults. We propose, benchmark, and discuss fault diagnosis methods for this post-quantum cryptography variant choosing a case study for hash functions, and present the simulations and implementations results to show the applicability of the presented schemes. The presented architectures can be tailored for different reliability objectives based on the resources available, and would initiate the new research area of reliable, error detection postquantum cryptographic architectures.

Using quantum key distribution this is achieved without relying on the hardness of mathematical problems, which might be compromised by improved algorithms or by future quantum computers. State-of-the-art quantum key distribution requires composable security against coherent attacks for a finite number of distributed quantum states as well as robustness against implementation side channels. Here we present an implementation of continuous-variable quantum key distribution satisfying these requirements. Our implementation is based on the distribution of continuous-variable Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled light. It is one-sided device independent, which means the security of the generated key is independent of any memoryfree attacks on the remote detector. Since continuous-variable encoding is compatible with conventional optical communication technology, our work is a step towards practical implementations of quantum key distribution with state-of-the-art security based solely on telecom components.

The main idea of this method is to use different broadband chaotic phase shifts, generated by electro-optic modulators and chaotic Colpitts circuits, to encode the information-bearing quantum signals coming from different users and then recover the masked quantum signals at the receiver side by imposing opposite chaotic phase shifts. The chaotic phase shifts given to different pairs of users are almost uncorrelated due to the randomness of chaos and thus the quantum signals from different pair of users can be distinguished even when they are sent via the same quantum channel. It is shown that two maximally entangled states can be generated between two pairs of users by our method mediated by bright coherent lights, which can be more easily implemented in experiments compared with single-photon lights. Our method is robust under the channel noises if only the decay rates of the information-bearing fields induced by the channel noises are not quite high. Our study opens up new perspectives for addressing and transmitting quantum information in future quantum networks.

As with other standard device-dependent quantum key distribution protocols, such as BB84, MDI QKD assumes that the reference frames have been shared between Alice and Bob. In practice, a nontrivial alignment procedure is often necessary, which requires system resources and may significantly reduce the secure key generation rate. Here, we propose a phase-coding reference-frame-independent MDI QKD scheme that requires no phase alignment between the interferometers of two distant legitimate parties. As a demonstration, a proof-of-principle experiment using Faraday-Michelson interferometers is presented. The experimental system worked at 1 MHz, and an average secure key rate of 8.309 bps was obtained at a fiber length of 20 km between Alice and Bob. The system can maintain a positive key generation rate without phase compensation under normal conditions. The results exhibit the feasibility of our system for use in mature MDI QKD devices and its value for network scenarios.

These quantum channels are based on accelerated multi-qubit states, where each qubit of each of these channels represents a partner. Namely, these states are the W state, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the GHZ-like state. Here, we show that the fidelity of teleporting accelerated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non-accelerated information, both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state. Also, the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that the degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel, type of the measurement, and value of the acceleration. The result of comparison concludes that teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is more robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the other two states. For future work, the proposed procedure can be generalized later to achieve communication through a wider quantum network.

Using the theory of completely positive linear maps, one can formulate the problem as an instance of a positive semidefinite feasibility problem with highly structured constraints. The nature of the constraints makes projection-based algorithms very appealing when the number of variables is huge and standard interior-point methods for semidefinite programming are not applicable. We provide empirical evidence to this effect. We moreover present heuristics for finding both high-rank and low-rank solutions.

We experimentally show that superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors allow QKD over a channel featuring 60 dB loss, and QKD with more than 600 bits of secret key per second (not considering finite key effects) over a 16 dB loss channel. This corresponds to 300 and 80 km of standard telecommunication fiber, respectively. We also demonstrate that the integration of our QKD system into FPGA-based hardware (instead of state-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators) does not impact on its performance. Our investigation allows us to acquire an improved understanding of the trade-offs between complexity, cost and system performance, which is required for future customization of MDI-QKD. Given that our system can be operated outside the laboratory over deployed fiber, we conclude that MDI-QKD is a promising approach to information-theoretic secure key distribution.

In order to put the complex data into three operations in sequence as multiplying the window, performing FFT, and computing module-square, and also meeting the requirements of high-speed digital signal processing, a novel scheme for implementing FFT with digital signal processing (DSP) C6701 is proposed in this paper. Firstly, Radix-4 algorithm of decimation in time (DIT) is adopted. Then, the improved bit-reverse algorithm is utilized for decreasing the calculation quantum. Pipeline and paralleled pattern are also considered conjointly. Based on these improvements, real-time and precision are all ensured, and the balance of calculation, communication and storage is also well weighted. Finally, a novel approach of flash programming by gel file and second boot loader is adopted, and by using this method, the format conversion of COFF file to hex file is not needed. Compared with MATLAB 6.5, the simulation and system application results all demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed scheme. Furthermore, the design can not only helps following real-time tracking on echo signal of Chinese national HY-2 satellite altimeter, but also provides beneficial engineering experience for FFT implementation in the other embedded systems of DSP.

(2015),2015,Limitations on quantum key repeaters,Nature Communications,10.1038/ncomms7908,"A major application of quantum communication is the distribution of entangled particles for use in quantum key distribution. Owing to noise in the communication line, quantum key distribution is, in practice, limited to a distance of a few hundred kilometres, and can only be extended to longer distances by use of a quantum repeater, a device that performs entanglement distillation and quantum teleportation. The existence of noisy entangled states that are undistillable but nevertheless useful for quantum key distribution raises the question of the feasibility of a quantum key repeater, which would work beyond the limits of entanglement distillation, hence possibly tolerating higher noise levels than existing protocols. Here we exhibit fundamental limits on such a device in the form of bounds on the rate at which it may extract secure key. As a consequence, we give examples of states suitable for quantum key distribution but unsuitable for the most general quantum key repeater protocol. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

These applications are characterized by the preponderance of data and computational complexity, and yet require reasonably fast processing in order to have any meaningful impact. As such, hardware acceleration for these applications have generated a lot of research interest. In this paper, we discuss the superiority of Network-on-Chip (NoC)-enabled many-core platforms over other conventional platforms in both the quantum of speedup achieved and the amount of energy consumed.

747,3,C1,D'Acunto (2015),2015,Nature-inspired computation,Nature-Inspired Computation,,"Nature inspired computation is an old idea, first proposed in the early fifties by Alan Turing, one of the founders of computer science. Turing suggested computational models of pattern formation in living systems based on systems of coupled reaction-diffusion equations giving rise to spatial patterns due to self-organization of substances in chemical concentrations. Since the pioneering work by Turing, many optimization algorithms stimulated by real-world features have gained great popularity and impact, thanks to their efficiency in solving nonlinear design problems. Nature-inspired computation has permeated into almost all areas of sciences, engineering and industries, from data mining to optimization, from computational intelligence to signal processing, from image analysis and vision systems to industrial applications. The book provides an introductory tour of the most popular nature inspired computational strategies. The book is subdivided in two parts, briefly describing the inspiration and motivation of natural processes and phenomena, main players, design principles, the scope of each branch, current trends and open problems. In the first section, attention is focused on Artificial and Spiking Neural Networks (Chapter 2), Evolutionary and Genetic Algorithms (Chapter 3), and Swarm Intelligence algorithms (Chapter 4). In the second section, we present the emergent knowledge and technologies in Multiscale Nature processes (Chapter 5), Quantum Computing and Quantum Cryptography (Chapter 6), Encryption and Secure Communication system (Chapter 7), Image processing and Vision systems (Chapter 8), and finally on Nanophotonics Information (Chapter 9).

(2015),2015,The future of real-time security: Latency-optimized lattice-based digital signatures,ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems,10.1145/2724714,"Advances in quantum computing have spurred a significant amount of research into public-key cryptographic algorithms that are resistant against postquantum cryptanalysis. Lattice-based cryptography is one of the important candidates because of its reasonable complexity combined with reasonable signature sizes. However, in a postquantum world, not only the cryptography will change but also the computing platforms. Large amounts of resource-constrained embedded systems will connect to a cloud of powerful server computers. We present an optimization technique for lattice-based signature generation on such embedded systems; our goal is to optimize latency rather than throughput. Indeed, on an embedded system, the latency of a single signature for user identification or message authentication is more important than the aggregate signature generation rate. We builda high-performance implementation using hardware/software codesign techniques. The key idea is to partition the signature generation scheme into offline and online phases. The signature scheme allows this separation because a large portion of the computation does not depend on the message to be signed and can be handled before the message is given. Then, we can map complex precomputation operations in software on a low-cost processor and utilize hardware resources to accelerate simpler online operations. To find the optimum hardware architecture for the target platform, we define and explore the design space and implement two design configurations. We realize our solutions on the Altera Cyclone-IV CGX150 FPGA. The implementation consists of a NIOS soft-core processor and a low-latency hash and polynomial multiplication engine. On average, the proposed low-latency architecture can generate a signature with a latency of 96 clock cycles at 40MHz, resulting in a response time of 2.4ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¼s for a signing request. On equivalent platforms, this corresponds to a performance improvement of 33 and 105 times compared to previous hardware and software implementations, respectively.

However, almost all popular signature schemes are either based on the factoring assumption (RSA) or the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem (DSA/ECDSA). In the case of classical cryptanalytic advances or progress on the development of quantum computers, the hardness of these closely related problems might be seriously weakened. A potential alternative approach is the construction of signature schemes based on the hardness of certain lattice problems that are assumed to be intractable by quantum computers. Due to significant research advancements in recent years, lattice-based schemes have now become practical and appear to be a very viable alternative to number-theoretic cryptography. In this article, we focus on recent developments and the current state of the art in lattice-based digital signatures and provide a comprehensive survey discussing signature schemes with respect to practicality. Additionally, we discuss future research areas that are essential for the continued development of lattice-based cryptography.

Here, we propose an application of the augmented Lorenz equations to chaotic cryptography, as a type of symmetric secret-key cryptographic method, wherein message encryption is performed by superimposing the chaotic signal generated from the equations on a plaintext in much the same way as in one-time pad cryptography. The ciphertext is decrypted by unmasking the chaotic signal precisely reproduced with a secret key consisting of 2N-1 (e.g., N=101) real numbers that specify the augmented Lorenz equations. The transmitter and receiver are assumed to be connected via both a quantum communication channel on which the secret key is distributed using a quantum key distribution protocol and a classical data communication channel on which the ciphertext is transmitted.

Obviously, the data recorded in BANs such as vital parameters are personal and should be private. To protect this privacy, such data are usually encrypted when transmitting it over a wireless link. In the past, many cryptographic algorithms and methods for the encryption and decryption of data have been proposed - and most of them have become obsolete. One-time pads (OTPs) were mathematically proven to be secure and impossible to crack. But, for most purposes, OTPs are complicated to handle, because if applied correctly, for each bit of plain text data, another bit of OTP must be available. Sensors in BANs usually do not generate an enormous amount of data. Hence, also the length of an OTP is not huge. Sustained progress in memory technology makes large amounts of nonvolatile memory available at cheap prices and small sizes. Thus, numerous OTPs can be preinstalled on BAN devices and ensure a long lasting and secure data transmission. In this paper, we present a concept for securing data transmission in BANs by utilizing OTPs. We delineate a system for generation, distribution, and utilization of OTPs in wireless sensor network (WSN) and BAN scenarios, and we show the implementation and evaluation of such a system.

Coupled with the rise of Big Data is also the development of faster computing systems which can collate and summarize data queries initiated by the enduser. The age of quantum computers whereby searching techniques will be accelerated beyond current abilities of the processing speeds of traditional digital processors will necessitate different ways to display information and analyze it.

Finding information using newer cognitive based modeling systems to help retrieve information as well as understanding the growth of data will be outlined. Visual demonstrations of new information modeling systems will be discussed and the implications of accessing data for the eventual solutions to complex problems will also be discussed.

Indian communication satellites in INSAT; Indian EO satellites in IRS; Indian positioning satellites in IRNSS; various science missions; Indian launch vehicles in the PSLV and GSLV; mission to Moon - Chandrayaan-1; a mission to Mars have paved the way for advanced successful development of space capability in India. Successful foray into global markets have also been achieved. All this has enabled a high-class end-to-end systemic capability of design, development and operations of Indian space assets and applications. Space based services have created a huge and growing user base - which is a unique opportunity for developing space industry and creating high technology jobs. Changing policy environment in India - favoring deregulation; investments and thrusted privatization; impetus to manufacturing; intensive co-operation etc are generating a strong market drive for space activities in India. Indian space needs to orient for a quantum jump in technological growth, adopt organisational models that will ensure economic efficiency and position a vibrant private sector. National consequences for Indian human space-flight and planetary exploration programme; quest for a larger share and role in global space market; strategies to deal with changing political and economic environments and focused imperatives of international cooperation need strategic focus. National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) has taken up a policy-research study to determine a futuristic Indian Space Policy - a comprehensive ""Indian Space Policy"" which addresses the long-term strategy of Indian space and promotes a holistic Indian Space enterprise - alignment to national goals of industrialization and development; evolving a vibrant eco-system of government-private sector partnership that assures operational space services (communications, EO and navigation etc) and advanced technology development; national commitment for Mong-term' human spaceflight and planetary exploration mission investments and a strategic international cooperation regime. NIAS has undertaken wide consultation with Indian space professionals and is organising a National Space Policy Workshop - all of which will be assimilated into the Policy document. The paper presents the outcome of this study and the future Indian Space Policy.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130527485&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.105.052407&partnerID=40&md5=8de71011e0f7bc44473f73ab0732ff5a,Article,5,0.724057615,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.036408996,0,0,0.015788363,0.036934277,0,0.219370068,0,0,0.056701435,0.027414613,0,0,0.026208847,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.030778114,0,0,0,0,0,0.025265394,0.033941022,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.119598372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.029809403,0,0.047073156,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.116088336,0,0.09599221,0.085316647,0,0,0.032484069,0,0,0,0.059657912,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.943161774,0,2.037993008,0.017160272

Indeed, recent studies on side-channel attacks have exposed the vulnerabilities of QKD implementations against an eavesdropper who may try to attack both the source and the measurement device. Here, we review two potential approaches that, combined, could bring this goal closer: measurement-device-independent QKD and the loss-tolerant QKD protocol. The former removes all possible side-channels from the measurement apparatus and guarantees a high performance over long distances. The latter appears as a robust solution against typical source flaws and it offers similar key rates as those of standard QKD systems. Most importantly, the feasibility of both solutions has already been demonstrated in several lab and field-test experiments.

In particular, we study the question of realizing cut-and-choose oblivious transfer and its variants in the OT-hybrid model. Towards this, we provide new definitions of cut-and-choose oblivious transfer (and its variants) that suffice for its application in cut-and-choose techniques for garbled circuit based two-party protocols. Furthermore, our definitions conceptually simplify previous definitions including those proposed by Lindell (Crypto 2013), Huang et al., (Crypto 2014), and Lindell and Riva (Crypto 2014). Our main result is an efficient realization (under our new definitions) of cut-and-choose OT and its variants with small concrete communication overhead in an OT-hybrid model. Among other things this implies that we can base cut-and-choose OT and its variants under a variety of assumptions, including those that are believed to be resilient to quantum attacks. By contrast, previous constructions of cut-and-choose OT and its variants relied on DDH and could not take advantage of OT extension.

(2015),2015,Secure satellite communication using multi-photon tolerant quantum communication protocol,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,10.1117/12.2188575,"This paper proposes and analyzes the potential of a multi-photon tolerant quantum communication protocol to secure satellite communication. For securing satellite communication, quantum cryptography is the only known unconditionally secure method. A number of recent experiments have shown feasibility of satellite-Aided global quantum key distribution (QKD) using different methods such as: Use of entangled photon pairs, decoy state methods, and entanglement swapping. The use of single photon in these methods restricts the distance and speed over which quantum cryptography can be applied. Contemporary quantum cryptography protocols like the BB84 and its variants suffer from the limitation of reaching the distances of only Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at the data rates of few kilobits per second. This makes it impossible to develop a general satellite-based secure global communication network using the existing protocols. The method proposed in this paper allows secure communication at the heights of the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. The benefits of the proposed method are two-fold: First it enables the realization of a secure global communication network based on satellites and second it provides unconditional security for satellite networks at GEO heights. The multi-photon approach discussed in this paper ameliorates the distance and speed issues associated with quantum cryptography through the use of contemporary laser communication (lasercom) devices. This approach can be seen as a step ahead towards global quantum communication.

The worldwide objective to accomplish Sustainability is invariably addressed by Policy makers and Institutions by means of moderately disparate co-relations between Environmental and Social considerations. The dimension of Social Sustainability has a direct co-relation towards the extended continuation of a globalized Enterprise. The stated co-relation is an interconnected and interdependent network comprising of growth in Innovation and Sustainability at the Environmental and Economic frontiers. From the standpoint of Innovation, the 20th century has been dominated by both TRIZ with OTSM and Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns to steer the future of revolutionary innovations. Moreover, TRIZ and its evolved counterpart OTSM have been extensively utilized for macroscale problem solving scenarios, while Kurzweil's Law has reached up to quantum scale whereby matter as we know exhibits an entire range of unique properties with a potential to dramatically transform our human civilization. Accordingly, the perceived limitations and vague applicability of TRIZ in sub-macro scale innovations has been discussed. The contemporary tools for project evaluation (e.g.: cost benefit analysis) and product development (e.g.: linear stage-gate process) quintessential for commercializing innovations are identified to be limited, both in scope and accuracy for delivering a long term 'sustainable' competitive advantage to an Enterprise. Consequently, the proposed conceptual Multifaceted Framework addresses the issue of social sustainability in Product Development. The underpinnings of Systems Thinking, TRIZ and OTSM, Complex Adaptive Systems, Socio-Economics & Human Behavior forms the fundamental basis of the proposed Multifaceted Framework. The novel perspective offered by the proposed Framework enables product development teams to overcome the inherent myopia and other limitations associated with the contemporary Environmental Life Cycle Analysis and Sustainability related Decision Models. An Expert opinion based evaluation technique in conjugation with a Multilayered Decision Modeling Method have been incorporated as a salient features in the proposed framework. The evaluation technique is utilized for assigning numerical values to the pertinent sustainability related criteria of the Multilayered Decision Model. The proposed Framework plays a crucial role in product development and decision modeling across the Idea Screening Phase (Stage 2) up to the Feasibility Analysis Phase (Stage 4). In addition, a modified version Taguchi Loss Function is included to exemplify a tangible relation between Product Quality parameters and Sustainability. The objective of the proposed framework is to provide an efficient, yet comprehensive evaluation as well as an effective product development strategy with a distinct and a holistic outlook on Social Sustainability.

Quantum Cryptography has practical weakness like lack of authentication, single photon generation and many real time implementation problems. This paper also explains how the drawback of BB84 protocol is eliminated by combining Classical Cryptography and Quantum techniques. Methods: We analyze the usage of Dual Channel Interferometer technique and thereby fusing Quantum techniques with classical technique. And their combination result in the feasibility of authentication, and hacker identification, thereby introducing a novel method of QKD transmission. A quantum digital authentication scheme based on hash function is proposed in this paper .The security of the quantum protocol lies on the existence of quantum one way function by fundamental quantum principle. The practical difficulties in quantum control and quantum computation made quantum protocol hard to implement. The lack of authentication made the quantum protocol vulnerable to hackers. Introducing two level quantum system authentications can be achieved with the help of hash function. To guarantee the authenticity, hash codes are split into two parts and exchange of code is made through two quantum channels. This scheme uses a programmable polarizer ensuring the quantum one way function and removing the practical difficulties of quantum control and quantum computation. The proposed scheme presents a novel method to construct secure quantum authentication for future communication. Result: Dual channel implementation helps in implementing authentication in quantum BB84 protocol. We combined the advantages of quantum techniques and classical techniques and tried to implement a novel technique to ensure secure communication. Application: People use the ATM for transactions such as cash withdrawal, money transfer and payment of electricity and telephone bills. ATM is the most convenient to access the accounts and funding transactions. Personal Identification Number (PIN) is an important aspect of the current ATM system in providing security and it is a commonly used method in protecting the transaction of one's account.By implementing above technique ATM pin transfer can be successfully made.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136983349&partnerID=40&md5=441784186bdf1fedefccbcb290e44efe,Conference Paper,4,0.839164495,0,0.246078116,0.199733057,0.070287612,0.062441732,0,0.058540531,0.057542138,0,0,0.024952519,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02166354,0,0.166393095,0.041421442,0,0.058972636,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.039534777,0,0,0,0,0.052473033,0.298608643,0.019965186,0.05364166,0,0,0.286246563,0.065958757,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.074396176,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07051746,0,0,0,0.189017738,0.047111895,0.055933936,0,0,0.095537609,0.246496615,0.041427614,0,0,0,0.080310756,0.176637605,0.147037465,0,0,0,0,0.643058193,0,0,0.02932883,0.219388402,0,0,0,0,0.062857062,0.052329432,0,0,0,0.074652161,0.06555163,0,0,0,0.073638338,4.269683955,0.637804494

The former allows two parties to share secret messages with information-theoretic security, even in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper in the communication channel, which is impossible with classical resources alone. The latter enables two distrustful parties to agree on a random bit, again with information-theoretic security, and with a cheating probability lower than the one that can be reached in a classical scenario. Our implementations rely on continuous-variable technology for quantum key distribution and on a plug and play discrete-variable system for coin flipping, and necessitate a rigorous security analysis adapted to the experimental schemes and their imperfections. In both cases, we demonstrate the protocols with provable security over record long distances in optical fibers and assess the performance of our systems as well as their limitations. The reported advances offer a powerful toolbox for practical applications of secure communications within future quantum networks.

Quantum cryptography is the study of information security based on the laws of quantum physics. Unlike classical cryptography focusing on mathematical complexity of algorithm in protecting information from attacks, quantum cryptography concentrates on the fundamental physical properties of the objects carrying information. These objects are identified by their quantum states which are unattackable by the computational power and will be widely applied in the future. This research paper also presents some main research areas of quantum cryptography and the study of BB84 protocol.

First, it aims to develop a system with a highly secured approach to transmitting electronic medical records (EMRs), and second, it aims to identify entities that transmit private patient information without permission. The NTRU and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptosystems are secured encryption methods. The AES is a tested technology that has already been utilized in several systems to secure sensitive data. The United States government has been using AES since June 2003 to protect sensitive and essential information. Meanwhile, NTRU protects sensitive data against attacks through the use of quantum computers, which can break the RSA cryptosystem and elliptic curve cryptography algorithms. A hybrid of AES and NTRU is developed in this work to improve EMR security. The proposed hybrid cryptography technique is implemented to secure the data transmission process of EMRs. The proposed security solution can provide protection for over 40Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â years and is resistant to quantum computers. Moreover, the technique provides the necessary evidence required by law to identify disclosure or misuse of patient records. The proposed solution can effectively secure EMR transmission and protect patient rights. It also identifies the source responsible for disclosing confidential patient records. The proposed hybrid technique for securing data managed by institutional websites must be improved in the future.

771,6,C3,Trinh et al. (2018),2018,Quantum Key Distribution over FSO: Current Development and Future Perspectives,2018 PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM (PIERS-TOYAMA),,"Due to the recent rapid growth of computing technologies, today's encrypted information based on classical computational complexities will soon no longer remain secure. Quantum cryptography, or quantum key distribution (QKD), relying on the physical laws of quantum mechanics, stands out as a more powerful cryptographic solution that enables the secret key to be shared securely over publicly unsecured communication channels in the presence of eavesdroppers. QKD can be possibly implemented over both optical fiber and free-space optical (FSO) links. Compared to optical fiber, FSO has the immediate advantage of flexibility and cost-effectiveness in terms of infrastructure deployment. More interestingly, recent advancements in satellite communications using FSO links promise the future of a global QKD network for highly secure applications. This paper reviews the development of QKD over FSO for both terrestrial and satellite channels, which highlights the most up-to-date QKD protocols. Owing to how the information is encoded, different QKD protocols are classified into technology-focused categories, where their properties are reviewed and compared.

The destructive use of quantum steganography methods to establish illegal covert communications is rising, so it is essential to introduce ways to detect hidden data in a quantum medium. Accordingly, this paper presents a frequency-based universal audio steganalysis approach to detecting quantum steganography. First, based on the quantum Fourier transform, the characteristic of the quantum spectrum centroid (QSC) was computed, and its circuit network was implemented to extract feature vectors. The proposed method classifies quantum audio signals using a quantum machine learning approach called a quantum ensemble of quantum classifiers. This approach was implemented within the framework of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which uses the superposition property to create an ensemble of classifiers evaluated in parallel, significantly increasing the computational speed. The accuracy weight of the classifiers is adjusted based on the classifiers' performance in training data classification; finally, the measurement of the first n qubits of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm predicts whether the quantum audio signals belong to the stego or clean class. The idea stems from the classic ensemble methods that try to build more robust models by combining different classifiers. The results show that the proposed frequency domain steganalysis method with 95% accuracy performs better than the previous methods in the time domain.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106333815&doi=10.1038%2fs41467-021-23147-3&partnerID=40&md5=d40ce83f7e4bc581cd464ee0ebb4dad5,Article,2,0.833881438,0,0,0,0,0.374770555,0,0,0,0.233014133,0,0,0,0,0.077069301,0,0,0,0.173363903,0,0.110964308,0.041434727,0,0.176974653,0,0,0,0.126052242,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.163621927,0,0,0,0.138361632,0,0,0,0.142008211,0,0,0,0.140163213,0,0,0,0,0.159013094,0,0,0,0,0,0.094254011,0,0.148840075,0,0.127424335,0,0,0,0.131551485,0,0.080336514,0,0,0.151435703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6583763,0.102711006,0.037400911,0.113817944,0.103836963,0,0.104692432,0,0.151435703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.06292528,0.58030389

Although the fundamental technology is not yet mature, research on quantum internet should be conducted. To implement quantum internet, an architecture that describes how quantum nodes are linked to form networks and how protocol functions are vertically composed need to be developed urgently. In this paper, we present a novel design of a cluster-based structure to describe how quantum nodes are interconnected, and how the structure can improve the performance of qubit transmission and reduce the network complexity. The idea of the quantum local area network (QLAN) is proposed as an essential component of the quantum internet. Besides, each quantum repeater links to neighboring repeaters to form a core network, and multiple QLANs are connected through the core network. The core network can be grouped into different hierarchical quantum repeater networks according to needed service requirements. For the sake of interoperability and fast prototyping, we adopt the idea of OSI layering model of the current Internet in the design of quantum internet.

This paper proposes a new method of traffic flow forecasting based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) strategy for intelligent transportation system (ITS). We establish a corresponding model based on the characteristics of the traffic flow data. The genetic simulated annealing algorithm is applied to the quantum particle swarm algorithm to obtain the optimized initial cluster center, and is applied to the parameter optimization of the radial basis neural network prediction model.

Firstly, the wind turbine, gas turbine, energy storage battery and load are integrated into a virtual power plant, and price-type demand response measures are implemented on the user side to improve the load curve. Then, aiming at maximizing the operating profit of the virtual power plant, the opportunity constraint model is used to describe the uncertainty of the wind turbine, load forecasting and internal power balance, and consider the operational constraints and network security constraints of each unit. The scheduling scheme is generated based on the reasonable control and coordination of the output of each component. Finally, the quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with inertia weight adaptive adjustment is used to solve the model.

Prolonging network lifetime is a fundamental issue for implementing IoT systems. The energy optimization problem, being NP-hard in nature for scalable networks, has been addressed in the literature using traditional metaheuristic techniques. Quantum inspired metaheuristics have shown better performance than their traditional counterparts in solving such optimization problems in different domains. Toward this end, this article proposes a quantum inspired green communication framework for Energy Balancing in sensor enabled IoT systems (Q-EBIoT). First, an energy optimization model for sensor enabled IoT environments is presented, where energy consumption is derived as cost of the energy-oriented paths. Second, a quantum computing oriented solution is developed for the optimization problem focusing on energy centric solution representation, measurement, and rotation angle. The proposed solution is implemented to evaluate the comparative performance with the state-of-the-art techniques.

This was recently shown to be a computationally intractable (NP-hard) problem. Financial crashes are inherently difficult to predict, even for a regulator which has complete information about the financial system. In this Rapid Communication, we show how this problem can be handled by quantum annealers. More specifically, we map the equilibrium condition of a toy-model financial network to the ground-state problem of a spin-1/2 quantum Hamiltonian with two-body interactions, i.e., a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. The equilibrium market values of institutions after a sudden shock to the network can then be calculated via adiabatic quantum computation and, more generically, by quantum annealers. Our procedure could be implemented on near-term quantum processors, thus providing a potentially more efficient way to assess financial equilibrium and predict financial crashes.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102982045&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1812%2f1%2f012005&partnerID=40&md5=358964cb38396ce2b5fed7b170693728,Conference Paper,1,0.79322356,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.059171145,0,0.25272986,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.138974159,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.116830704,0,0,0,0,0.132827966,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.177865826,0,0,0,0.19140938,0,0,0,0.79902458,0,0,0,0,0.118359922,0,0.187862995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.137496605,0,0,0,0.192617539,0.083793338,0,0.146677152,0.106821252,0,0.148285083,0.089792247,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.080539753,0.307097646

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and - due to their long life span - also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), namely NewHope, NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and Saber.

In this manuscript, the authors simulate the performance of memory-assisted quantum key distribution (MA-QKD) schemes under a range of operating conditions and network configurations, with encouraging conclusions as to the feasibility of implementing such networks with near-term devices. A global quantum repeater network involving satellite-based links is likely to have advantages over fiber-based networks in terms of long-distance communication, since the photon losses in vacuum scale only polynomially with the distance - compared to the exponential losses in optical fibers. To simulate the performance of such networks, we have introduced a scheme of large-scale event-based Monte Carlo simulation of quantum repeaters with multiple memories that can faithfully represent loss and imperfections in these memories. In this work, we identify the quantum key distribution rates achievable in various satellite and ground station geometries for feasible experimental parameters. The power and flexibility of the simulation toolbox allows us to explore various strategies and parameters, some of which only arise in these more complex, multi-satellite repeater scenarios.

However, QKD requires the classical channel to be authenticated, the current method for which is pre-sharing symmetric keys. For a QKD network of n users, this method requires C-n(2) = n(n - 1)/2 pairs of symmetric keys to realize pairwise interconnection. In contrast, with the help of a mature public key infrastructure (PKI) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with quantum-resistant security, each user only needs to apply for one digital certificate from a certificate authority (CA) to achieve efficient and secure authentication for QKD. We need to assume only the short-term security of the PQC algorithm to achieve long-term security of the distributed keys. Here, we experimentally verified the feasibility, efficiency, and stability of the PQC algorithm in QKD authentication, and demonstrated the advantages when new users join the QKD network. Using the PQC public-key infrastructure, the nodes need to mutually trust only the CA to authenticate each other.

806,2,C1,Hasan et al. (2022),2022,Edge Caching in Fog-Based Sensor Networks through Deep Learning-Associated Quantum Computing Framework,COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,10.1155/2022/6138434,"Fog computing (FC) based sensor networks have emerged as a propitious archetype for next-generation wireless communication technology with caching, communication, and storage capacity services in the edge. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new era of digital communication and has a rising demand for intelligent devices and applications. It faces performance deterioration and quality of service (QoS) degradation problems, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) based scenarios. Therefore, existing caching strategies need to be enhanced to augment the cache hit ratio and manage the limited storage to accelerate content deliveries. Alternatively, quantum computing (QC) appears to be a prospect of more or less every typical computing problem. The framework is basically a merger of a deep learning (DL) agent deployed at the network edge with a quantum memory module (QMM). Firstly, the DL agent prioritizes caching contents via self organizing maps (SOMs) algorithm, and secondly, the prioritized contents are stored in QMM using a Two-Level Spin Quantum Phenomenon (TLSQP). After selecting the most appropriate lattice map (32x32) in 750,000 iterations using SOMs, the data points below the dark blue region are mapped onto the data frame to get the videos. These videos are considered a high priority for trending according to the input parameters provided in the dataset. Similarly, the light-blue color region is also mapped to get medium-prioritized content. After the SOMs algorithm's training, the topographic error (TE) value together with quantization error (QE) value (i.e., 0.0000235) plotted the most appropriate map after 750,000 iterations. In addition, the power of QC is due to the inherent quantum parallelism (QP) associated with the superposition and entanglement principles. A quantum computer taking n qubits that can be stored and execute 2(n) presumable combinations of qubits simultaneously reduces the utilization of resources compared to conventional computing. It can be analyzed that the cache hit ratio will be improved by ranking the content, removing redundant and least important content, storing the content having high and medium prioritization using QP efficiently, and delivering precise results. The experiments for content prioritization are conducted using Google Colab, and IBM's Quantum Experience is considered to simulate the quantum phenomena.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091285222&doi=10.1007%2fs11128-020-02864-6&partnerID=40&md5=9c1c1078ec7230985e1fce485bdfef6c,Article,2,0.850053549,0,0,0,0.166305664,0,0,0,0,0.183717273,0,0.059039497,0,0,0,0,0,0.212031113,0.153772588,0,0,0.147009272,0.148629473,0.488367596,0,0,0.147301108,0,0,0,0,0.11509264,0.172475448,0.30086299,0,0,0,0,0.126920116,0,0,0,0.156063275,0.149076628,0,0,0,0,0,0.335894148,0.160529592,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.094029013,0,0,0,0.160022315,0,0,0.26468762,0,0,0,0,0.098020783,0,0,0,0.09501058,0,0,0,0.146426235,0,0,0,0.089739066,0,0,0,0,0.132697402,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.171321947,0,0,0.167947074,0,0,0,4.642990456,0.741622867

(2022),2022,Secure IoT in the Era of Quantum Computers-Where Are the Bottlenecks?,SENSORS,10.3390/s22072484,"Recent progress in quantum computers severely endangers the security of widely used public-key cryptosystems and of all communication that relies on it. Thus, the US NIST is currently exploring new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are robust against quantum computers. Security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices-even with pre-quantum public-key cryptography-since IoT devices have tight energy constraints, limited computational power and strict memory limitations. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth investigation of the application of potential post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms (DSAs) proposed in the related US NIST process to a state-of-the-art, TLS-based, low-power IoT infrastructure. We implemented these new KEMs and DSAs in such a representative infrastructure and measured their impact on energy consumption, latency and memory requirements during TLS handshakes on an IoT edge device. Based on our investigations, we gained the following new insights. First, we show that the main contributor to high TLS handshake latency is the higher bandwidth requirement of post-quantum primitives rather than the cryptographic computation itself. Second, we demonstrate that a smart combination of multiple DSAs yields the most energy-, latency- and memory-efficient public key infrastructures, in contrast to NIST's goal to standardize only one algorithm. Third, we show that code-based, isogeny-based and lattice-based algorithms can be implemented on a low-power IoT edge device based on an off-the-shelf Cortex M4 microcontroller while maintaining viable battery runtimes. This is contrary to much research that claims dedicated hardware accelerators are mandatory.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094662159&doi=10.1109%2fAEECA49918.2020.9213490&partnerID=40&md5=b5f0cf2129943ad0a5d060802f584150,Conference Paper,4,0.843660474,0,0,0.110897343,0,0,0,0.097509988,0,0.258668878,0,0.041562996,0,0,0,0,0,0.074633497,0.216507584,0,0,0.034497503,0,0.245574347,0,0.081023639,0.414791835,0,0,0,0,0.081023639,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.136227467,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22602126,0.35353478,0,0.116696337,0.1206083,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.111594017,0.450614057,0,0.0784735,0,0.123920472,0,0.053045135,0,0,0,0.10952643,0.175287104,0,0,0.146950715,0,0,0.080162207,0,0,0,0,0.195410176,0,0,0,0.094761934,0.172904044,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.402429187,0.674721596
810,1,C5,Duenas-Osorio et al. (2018),2018,Quantum-inspired Boolean states for bounding engineering network reliability assessment,STRUCTURAL SAFETY,10.1016/j.strusafe.2018.05.004,"Significant methodological progress has taken place to quantify the reliability of networked systems over the past decades. Both numerical and analytical methods have enjoyed improvements via a host of advanced Monte Carlo simulation strategies, state space partition methods, statistical learning, and Boolean functions among others. The latter approach exploits logic to approximate network reliability assessments efficiently while offering theoretical error guarantees. In parallel, physicists have made progress modeling complex systems via tensor networks (TNs), particularly quantum many-body systems. Inspired by the representation power of quantum TNs, this paper offers a new approach to efficiently bound all-terminal network reliability (ATR). It does so by exactly solving a related network Boolean satisfiability counting problem (or #SAT(NET)), represented as a TN, by counting configurations in which all network nodes are connected to at least a neighbor. Our #SAT(NET )counting outperforms state-of-the-art approximate and exact counters for the same problem as shown for challenging two-dimensional lattice networks of increasing size. While the over-counting from #SAT NET increases exponentially relative to the number of configurations that satisfy ATR problems (or #RELAT), the bias is predictable for ideal networks, such as lattices, and our upper bound is guaranteed with 100% confidence. This bound also cuts through the upper bound from other analytical methods for the ATR problem, such as recursive decomposition algorithms (RDA)-a desirable feature when exact or approximate methods with error guarantees fail to scale. Clearly, our goal is not to solve the general stochastic network reliability problem, which remains a #P problem in the computational complexity hierarchy (i.e., a counting version of non-deterministic polynomial time [NP] problems for which there is no known polynomial time algorithms to find their solutions). Instead, we present a novel bounding technique for network reliability, which relies on exactly counting configurations for our network satisfiability problem by using quantum computing principles. We offer a proof for the counting bound to hold in a connectivity ATR sense, and illustrate trends with cubic and lattice networks. Overall, the proposed method provides an alternative to available system reliability assessment approaches, and opens directions for future research, especially as discoveries in logic, algebraic projections, and quantum computation continue to accrue.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091670905&doi=10.1209%2f0295-5075%2f131%2f40005&partnerID=40&md5=19ca160ac0207f56b84d4fc834646aa1,Article,1,0.843868792,0,0,0,0,0.246499301,0.199208792,0,0,0.102174197,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.085992972,0,0,0,0.116402229,0,0,0,0,0.096245916,0,0,0.128017338,0,0,0,0,0.098234011,0.026271984,0,0,0,0,0,0.082908833,0,0.182010273,0,0,0,0.093403615,0,0,0.097897164,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.088996268,0,0.061994059,0.588823133,0.195794328,0,0.041905653,0,0.054514171,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.099604396,0.08143482,0.189984413,0,0.094021519,0,0,0,0.360863679,0.067556511,0.319798014,0,0,0.165425925,0.137719524,0,0,0,0.098234011,0,0,0.095280548,0.093403615,0,4.390621212,0.67143774

But, traditional public-key cryptographic primitives we use today are believed to be breakable by large scale quantum computers of the future. Thus, NIST is currently running a global global level standardization process for quantum-resistant public-key cryptography, better known as post-quantum cryptography. In this work, we perform a first of its kind practical implementation of a secure authentication protocol for automotive systems with post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and perform a detailed comparative evaluation of the speed and communication bandwidth performance against their pre-quantum counterparts.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085519606&doi=10.1109%2fDRCN48652.2020.1570611062&partnerID=40&md5=72910ef8a8b97ae5ceeb024e28bfe97e,Conference Paper,3,0.829925954,0,0,0.613818536,0,0,0,0.134929829,0,0.089483519,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103274394,0.049932203,0,0,0.095472112,0.144786476,0.135925787,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046017676,0,0,0,0.094252646,0.152028069,0,0,0,0.107158365,0,0.167452257,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.145222069,0,0,0.274793335,0,0,0,0,0.145222069,0,0,0,0,0,0.34088942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.338906049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.202799699,0,0,0.043088783,0.131127198,0,0.144878984,0.120613892,0.131127198,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.953200565,0.549788908

There are quantum neurons that can carry an exponential amount of information to a linear number of quantum information units (qubits) using the quantum property of superposition. In this paper, we compare the performance of three of these quantum neuron models applied to the diabetes classification problem. We also propose the use of different data preprocessing strategies. Quantum neurons were simulated using the IBM Qiskit tool. We compare the preprocessing approaches applied to two toy problems (1) simulating the XOR operator and (2) solving a generic nonlinear problem. The results of the experiments shows that a single quantum neuron is capable of achieving an accuracy rate of 100% in the XOR problem and an accuracy rate of 100% in a non-linear dataset, demonstrating that the quantum neurons with real weights are capable of modeling non-linearly separable problems. In the problem of diagnosing diabetes, quantum neurons achieved an accuracy rate of 76% and AUC-ROC of 88%, while its classic version, the perceptron, reached only 63% accuracy and the artificial neural network reached 80% AUC-ROC.

Both of these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Heuristic stochastic optimization methods like genetic algorithm perform global search, but they suffer from the problem of slow convergence rate near global optimum. On the other hand deterministic methods like gradient descent exhibit a fast convergence rate around global optimum but may get stuck in a local optimum. Motivated by these problems, a hybrid learning algorithm combining genetic algorithm (GA) with gradient descent (GD), called HGAGD, is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm combines the global exploration ability of GA with the accurate local exploitation ability of GD to achieve a faster convergence and also a better accuracy of final solution. The HGAGD is then employed as a new training method to optimize the parameters of a quantum-inspired neural network (QINN) for two different applications. Firstly, two benchmark functions are chosen to demonstrate the potential of the proposed QINN with the HGAGD algorithm in dealing with function approximation problems. Next, the performance of the proposed method in forecasting Mackey-Glass time series and Lorenz attractor is studied. The results of these studies show the superiority of the introduced approach over other published approaches. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076394859&doi=10.1364%2fOE.27.037087&partnerID=40&md5=6bf9d50355ac8fccfdebb719ba188acd,Article,1,0.823599041,0,0,0,0,0.09674684,0,0,0,0.120304974,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06942297,0.100696069,0.101252396,0,0,0.291984493,0,0,0.075366986,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.115665604,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.195241956,0.101879859,0.107153967,0.072033848,0,0,0,0,0.1096176,0,0,0.112188049,0.097620978,0,0.385833203,0.184721194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1733274,0,0,0.049341797,0,0.064187692,0,0,0,0.062216498,0,0,0.117279163,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.636355129,0,0,0,0,0.324315614,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.764754277,0.497381069

We present the first results applying Q-NAS on the CIFAR-10 dataset using only 20 K80 GPUs for about 50 hours. The obtained networks are relatively small (less than 20 layers) compared to other state-of-the-art models and achieve promising accuracies with considerably less computational cost than other NAS algorithms.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073054169&doi=10.1007%2fs11433-019-1438-6&partnerID=40&md5=3cb68c583cc6baa8cf502c1aba852188,Article,1,0.829755127,0.719558593,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.093394097,0.252049112,0,0,0.189483035,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.101955374,0.143573815,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.099260866,0,0,0,0,0,0.112248319,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.120749142,0,0.117521733,0,0,0.101044155,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.152930465,0.090783896,0.120749142,0.244855982,0.103375244,0,0,0,0,0.085400608,0.130348834,0,0,0.245709781,0,0.078110723,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.083326119,0.09102645,0.092336818,0,0,0.169867171,0.092336818,0,0,0,0,0.115206671,0,0,0,3.947202964,0.548120945

To figure out this problem and enhance the forecasting performance, a novel compound structure is developed for short-term wind speed forecasting. The developed compound method firstly eliminates the inherent noise from the original empirical wind speed time series using wavelet packet decom-position (WPD) and subsequently constructs appropriate input matrix by phase space reconstruction (PSR) for multi-kernel least square support vector machine (MKLSSVM). To take advantage of different kernel function, MKLSSVM with optimal combination of radial basis kernel function, polynomial kernel function and linear kernel function is constructed to make wind speed forecasting. Then, the proposed improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) based on the chaos initialization, Gaussian distribution local attraction points, precocity judgment, and disturbance operator, namely ADQPSO, is employed to optimize the decomposition level of WPD, reconstruction parameters of PSR, kernel parameters and weighted coefficients in MKLSSVM synchronously. To evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model, four sets of historical wind speed data samples from Weihai wind farm in China are utilized to make multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting tests. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms the compared single and new recently developed forecasting models, thus, the proposed WPD-PSR-ADQPSO-MKLSSVM is an effective method for short-term wind speed forecasting.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Although continued progress in the fabrication and control of qubits is required, quantum computing scalability will depend as well on a comprehensive architectural design considering a distributed multi-core approach as an alternative to the traditional monolithic version, hence including a communications perspective. However, this goes beyond introducing mere interconnects. Rather, it implies consolidating the full communications stack in the quantum computer structure. In this paper, we propose a double full-stack architecture encompassing quantum computation and quantum communications, which we use to address the monolithic versus distributed question with a structured design methodology. For that, we revisit the different quantum computing layers to capture and model their essence by highlighting the open design variables and performance metrics.

Several wormhole detection approaches have been proposed, but most of them need special hardware devices and consume a lot of system resources. This paper proposes a novel and efficient method to detect the wormhole attack without hardware equipment or requiring much information about WSN. The proposed method uses a moving average (MA) indicator, which has been commonly used in financial fields, to apply to neighbors of sensor nodes; it becomes a dynamic detection indicator of the number of neighbor nodes. Because the combinations are too numerous to arrange, we utilize a Quantum-inspired Tabu Search (QTS) algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and effective in finding the ideal combination of detection indicators to detect wormhole attacks in different scenarios.

In contrast to the classic Diffie-Hellman, it involves floating point numbers of arbitrary size in the generation of a shared secret. This can, in turn, be used for encrypted communication based on symmetric cyphers. The validity of the algorithm is verified by proving that a vital part of the algorithm satisfies a one-way property. The decimal part is deployed for the one-way function in a way that makes the protocol a post-quantum key generation procedure. This is concluded from the fact that there is, as of yet, no quantum computer algorithm reverse engineering the one-way function. An example illustrating the use of the protocol in combination with XOR encryption is given.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067344068&doi=10.1364%2fJOCN.11.000285&partnerID=40&md5=f9decbba63db2256c6b792402171c613,Article,1,0.805598497,0,0,0.152094375,0,0,0,0,0,0.354761262,0,0.05700315,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.098979185,0,0.126706386,0.047312912,0,0.202081362,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.341080458,0.045609764,0.367627442,0.139710511,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.169955441,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.107625463,0,0,0,0,0.563112825,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.067000678,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.341080458,0,0,0.165412836,0,0,3.347154507,0.38124452

In daylight free-space quantum communication based on direct detection, the required Field Of View (FoV) of the receiver system needs to be minimised to reduce solar background noise coupling into the detectors. Reducing the FoV requires minimising beam wander effects caused by atmospheric turbulence through active optics. We implement a fine tracking system designed to correct tip and tilt wavefront aberrations, using two feedback loops; each of them consisting of a quadrant detector and a fast steering mirror for stabilising the beam in the whole optical axis of the receiver. We test the performance of the tracking system with different optical fibres in order to evaluate the reduction in the quantum bit error rate (QBER) caused by solar background noise. A reduction of 75% for single mode fibre was obtained, and 45% reduction for a 25 mu m core diameter fibre, both cases for strong turbulence (C-n(2) similar to 10(-12) -10(-13) m(-2/3)) and 100 m propagating channel.

Namely, the parties seeking to achieve some cryptographic task, often start by establishing a common high-entropy secret that will eventually be used to secure their communication. In this paper, we put forward a security model for group key establishment (GAKE) with an adversary that may execute efficient quantum algorithms, yet only once the execution of the protocol has concluded. This captures a situation in which keys are to be established in the present, while security guarantees must still be provided in the future when quantum resources may be accessible to a potential adversary. Further, we propose a protocol design that can be proven secure in this model. Our proposal uses password authentication and builds upon efficient and reasonably well understood primitives: a message authentication code and a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism. The hybrid structure dodges potential efficiency downsides, like large signatures, of some true post-quantum authentication techniques, making our protocol a potentially interesting fit for current applications with long-term security needs.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063164090&doi=10.1140%2fepjd%2fe2019-90374-y&partnerID=40&md5=c23d243ffbbfd4a0c54f888204245df2,Article,3,0.835851133,0,0,0.141408706,0,0,0,0.124338066,0.122217514,0.082459215,0,0.052998289,0.123980777,0,0,0,0,0.09516753,0,0,0,0.043988857,0,0,0,0,0,0.133822384,0,0,0,0.309947407,0,0,0,0,0,0.084810734,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15430754,0,0,0,0,0,0.153791454,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.426891169,0,0,0.100064039,0,0,0,0.135279056,0.418840241,0.087990821,0,0,0,0,0,0.374763001,0,0,0,0,0.151759267,0,0.143195223,0.311467112,0,0.218084683,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.150761914,0,0,0,4.142334997,0.602388123

Though they are solvable in polynomial time, in practice they can be too slow to be used in online, i.e. real-time applications. Here we propose to solve feasibility semidefinite programs using artificial neural networks (NNs). Given the optimization constraints as an input, a NN outputs values for the optimization parameters such that the constraints are satisfied, both for the primal and the dual formulations of the task. We train the network without having to exactly solve the semidefinite program even once, thus avoiding the possibly time-consuming task of having to generate many training samples with conventional solvers. The NN method is only inconclusive if both the primal and dual models fail to provide feasible solutions. Otherwise we always obtain a certificate, which guarantees false positives to be excluded. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we examine the performance of the method on a hierarchy of quantum information tasks, the Navascues-Pironio-Acin hierarchy applied to the Bell scenario. We demonstrate that the trained NN gives decent accuracy, while showing orders of magnitude increase in speed compared to a traditional solver, once trained.

Most of the recent efforts applying neural networks to ab initio calculation have been focusing on the energy of the system. In this study, we take a step forward and look at the interatomic force obtained with neural network wavefunction methods by implementing and testing several commonly used force estimators in variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC). Our results show that neural network ansatz can improve the calculation of interatomic force upon traditional VMC.

In this paper, we proposed a hybrid chaotic radial basis function neural oscillatory network (HCRBFNON) based foreign exchange (Forex) product price series prediction and quantum price levels based hedging trading system. In our forecasting system, the HCRBFNON consists of three components: 1) Quantum Finance Theory to model the secondary financial market and extract the financial dynamic energy level feature, 2) Long short-term memory mechanism to extract the temporal financial feature, 3) Chaotic type-2 transient-fuzzy membership function based transient chaotic radial basis layer to model the highly chaotic financial time series. In the quantum finance hedging & trading system (QFHTS), we employ the forecasting prices from the HCRBFNON and the respective nearest quantum price levels to construct the trading timing capture. In the model evaluation, we measure the performance CRBFNON with 5 popular models used in financial time series prediction; we also compared the trading performance of QFHTS with 2 classical technical analysis-based trading strategies. By using 12 most popular forex product datasets from 2011 to 2019 for the system testing, the experimental results revealed that both the HCRBFNON and QFHTS achieve promising results in terms of forecast and trading performances respectively.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059985559&doi=10.1364%2fOL.44.000275&partnerID=40&md5=85078cc00aa59a13e99f25d9b8d753d0,Article,1,0.821715891,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12171552,0,0.147234004,0.052780606,0,0,0,0,0,0.094776641,0.183294477,0,0.117320529,0,0.132872974,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14442623,0,0.473722057,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.148191996,0,0,0,0,0.252182445,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.159553837,0.067361707,0,0,0,0,0,0.169876647,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.285214132,0,0,0.434377855,0.079086595,0,0,0.332394675,0.332068167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.728451094,0.487284975

In this paper, we present the parallel algebraic computation of special invariants called symplectic and focus on one particular invariant that finds recent interest in physics. Our results will export to other invariants. The cost of performing basic computations on the multivariate polynomials evolves during the computation, as the polynomials get larger and/or have increasing numbers of terms. Interestingly, in some cases, they stay small. Traditionally, high-performance software is optimized by running experiments with sample data sets in order to profile and optimize expected behavior of workloads in practice. Since the (communication and computation) costs depend on the changing behavior of the symplectic invariant calculations, the standard optimization approach is insufficient. Thus, it is necessary to implement online performance tuning methods that can track the algorithm's progress and state, evaluate performance data in situ, and control the parallel resources during execution.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085546170&partnerID=40&md5=2cf90ce96f6fc9b4a58e9e5f21e3d0b0,Conference Paper,2,0.830726981,0,0,0,0,0.141316818,0,0,0,0.087863935,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.168371865,0.202810413,0,0,0,0.04687207,0,0.333664084,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.143889608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.092546745,0,0,0,0.156518371,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.563581413,0.359759713,0,0.305161669,0,0,0.14259366,0.106622653,0,0.168371865,0,0,0,0,0,0.14881455,0,0.090878809,0,0,0,0,0.108917115,0,0,0,0.152580834,0,0.124128807,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.168951205,0,0.160643478,0,0,0,3.974859681,0.555812414

Whether a quantum advantage can be rigorously proven in some setting or demonstrated experimentally using near-term devices is the subject of active debate. We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality.

Central to these networks is the ability to distribute entanglement between distant nodes using photonic channels. Initially developed for quantum teleportation(3,4) and loophole-free tests of Bell's inequality(5,6) recently, entanglement distribution has also been achieved over telecom fibres and analysed retrospectively(7,8). Yet, to fully use entanglement over long-distance quantum network links it is mandatory to know it is available at the nodes before the entangled state decays. Here we demonstrate heralded entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms generated over fibre links with a length up to 33 km. For this, we generate atom-photon entanglement in two nodes located in buildings 400 m line-of-sight apart and to overcome high-attenuation losses in the fibres convert the photons to telecom wavelength using polarization-preserving quantum frequency conversion(9). The long fibres guide the photons to a Bell-state measurement setup in which a successful photonic projection measurement heralds the entanglement of the atoms(10). Our results show the feasibility of entanglement distribution over telecom fibre links useful, for example, for device-independent quantum key distribution(11-13) and quantum repeater protocols.

In this scenario, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be employed to enhance the capacity of quantum information processing and to distribute quantum entanglement in an efficient and scalable way with multiple users. Here, a method for realizing a multiplexed continuous variable (CV) quantum entanglement distribution based on a four-wave mixing process combined with an active routing technique is experimentally demonstrated. By exploiting Sagnac-based OAM sorters, the OAM entanglement can be distributed and measured with the different users in a quasi-complete star network configuration.

Therefore, this study developed an intelligent hybrid air-quality forecasting system based on feature selection and a modified evolving interval type-2 quantum fuzzy neural network (eIT2QFNN), which provides accurate air-quality forecasting information by considering climate influencing factors. The main contributions of this study are as follows. The optimal input structure of the model is determined by the proposed second-stage feature-selection model, which can better extract the influencing variables and remove redundant information. Moreover, a novel multi-objective chaotic Bonobo optimizer algorithm is proposed to improve the eIT2QFNN. The modified eIT2QFNN implements AQI prediction by considering the importance of influencing variables that can cope with the uncertainties and fuzziness in the forecasting process. Finally, the Diebold-Mariano and modified Diebold-Mariano tests are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly improves the modeling performance in terms of high accuracy and compact structure, and can thus serve as an effective tool for air-quality management.

(2018),2018,Hybridizing Chaotic and Quantum Mechanisms and Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm with Least Squares Support Vector Regression Model in Electric Load Forecasting,ENERGIES,10.3390/en11092226,"Compared with a large power grid, a microgrid electric load (MEL) has the characteristics of strong nonlinearity, multiple factors, and large fluctuation, which lead to it being difficult to receive more accurate forecasting performances. To solve the abovementioned characteristics of a MEL time series, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVR) hybridizing with meta-heuristic algorithms is applied to simulate the nonlinear system of a MEL time series. As it is known that the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) has several embedded drawbacks that lead to problems, this paper applies a quantum computing mechanism (QCM) to empower each fruit fly to possess quantum behavior during the searching processes, i.e., a QFOA algorithm. Eventually, the cat chaotic mapping function is introduced into the QFOA algorithm, namely CQFOA, to implement the chaotic global perturbation strategy to help fruit flies to escape from the local optima while the population's diversity is poor. Finally, a new MEL forecasting method, namely the LS-SVR-CQFOA model, is established by hybridizing the LS-SVR model with CQFOA. The experimental results illustrate that, in three datasets, the proposed LS-SVR-CQFOA model is superior to other alternative models, including BPNN (back-propagation neural networks), LS-SVR-CQPSO (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm), LS-SVR-CQTS (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum tabu search algorithm), LS-SVR-CQGA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum genetic algorithm), LS-SVR-CQBA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum bat algorithm), LS-SVR-FOA, and LS-SVR-QFOA models, in terms of forecasting accuracy indexes.

Among other sources, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can generate polarization-entangled photon pairs with near-unity entanglement fidelity and a multiphoton emission probability close to zero even at maximum brightness. These properties have been demonstrated under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE) and at operation temperatures below 10 K. However, source blinking is often reported under TPE conditions, limiting the maximum achievable photon rate. In addition, operation temperatures reachable with compact cryocoolers could facilitate the widespread deployment of QDs, e.g., in satellite-based quantum communication. We demonstrate blinking-free emission of highly entangled photon pairs from GaAs QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode. High fidelity entanglement persists at temperatures of at least 20 K, which we use to implement fiber-based QKD between two buildings with an average raw key rate of 55 bits/s and a qubit error rate of 8.4%. We are confident that by combining electrical control with already demonstrated photonic and strain engineering, QDs will keep approaching the ideal source of entangled photons for real world applications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062804695&doi=10.1364%2fOE.27.005125&partnerID=40&md5=7182cc74b08af5b7bc7bda3098c39a35,Article,6,0.796376646,0,0,0,0,0.080383667,0,0,0.074076229,0,0,0.032122347,0,0,0,0,0,0.115362382,0.111553265,0,0,0.026661716,0,0,0,0.187859615,0,0,0,0,0.101789307,0,0.656885907,0,0,0,0,0.02570196,0.069054993,0.078729501,0,0.052642331,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.087341315,0,0,0,0,0.243329877,0,0,0,0.544679194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09710468,0,0,0,0.232743179,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.113268427,0,0,0.024066104,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.168774321,0,0,0,0,3.124130318,0.319220397

(2015),2015,Teleportation with Multiple Accelerated Partners,COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS,,"As the current revolution in communication is underway, quantum teleportation can increase the level of security in quantum communication applications. In this paper, we present a quantum teleportation procedure that capable to teleport either accelerated or non-accelerated information through different quantum channels. These quantum channels are based on accelerated multi-qubit states, where each qubit of each of these channels represents a partner. Namely, these states are the W state, Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the GHZ-like state. Here, we show that the fidelity of teleporting accelerated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non-accelerated information, both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state. Also, the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that the degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel, type of the measurement, and value of the acceleration. The result of comparison concludes that teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is more robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the other two states. For future work, the proposed procedure can be generalized later to achieve communication through a wider quantum network.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060928216&doi=10.23919%2fPIERS.2018.8597918&partnerID=40&md5=5e1897a0fc5c3acd81ddac5facb6cb50,Conference Paper,6,0.779616356,0,0.696763384,0,0,0,0,0.082877947,0.081464486,0,0,0.035326184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.122679427,0,0,0.087962751,0,0,0,0,0,0.08919975,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028265437,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.097910381,0.329099408,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.099185254,0,0,0,0,0.056262102,0,0,0,0,0,0.066698014,0,0,0,0.04508535,0,0,0,0,0,0.056849421,0,0.041633252,0,0,0.545066559,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026466423,0,0.14695861,0,0,0.080542258,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.816296397,0.23361027
869,6,C3,Bouchard et al. (2018),2018,Quantum cryptography with twisted photons through an outdoor underwater channel,OPTICS EXPRESS,10.1364/OE.26.022563,"Quantum communication has been successfully implemented in optical fibres and through free-space. Fibre systems, though capable of fast key and low error rates, are impractical in communicating with destinations without an established fibre link. Free-space quantum channels can overcome such limitations and reach long distances with the advent of satellite-toground links. However, turbulence, resulting from local fluctuations in refractive index, becomes a major challenge by adding errors and losses. Recently, an interest in investigating the possibility of underwater quantum channels has arisen. Here, we investigate the effect of turbulence on an underwater quantum channel using twisted photons in outdoor conditions. We study the effect of turbulence on transmitted error rates, and compare different quantum cryptographic protocols in an underwater quantum channel, showing the feasibility of high-dimensional encoding schemes. Our work may open the way for secure high-dimensional quantum communication between submersibles, and provides important input for potential submersibles-to-satellite quantum communication.

It is a precondition to distribute OAM multiplexed quantum resources in quantum channels for implementing quantum communication. However, quantum steering of OAM multiplexed optical fields and the effect of channel noise on OAM multiplexed quantum resources remain unclear. Here, we generate OAM multiplexed continuous-variable (CV) entangled states and distribute them in lossy or noisy channels. We show that the decoherence property of entanglement and quantum steering of the OAM multiplexed states carrying topological charges l = 1 and l = 2 are the same as that of the Gaussian mode with l = 0 in lossy and noisy channels. The sudden death of entanglement and quantum steering of high-order OAM multiplexed states is observed in the presence of excess noise. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to realize high data-carrying capacity quantum information processing by utilizing OAM multiplexed CV entangled states.

(2015),2015,Limitations on quantum key repeaters,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,10.1038/ncomms7908,"A major application of quantum communication is the distribution of entangled particles for use in quantum key distribution. Owing to noise in the communication line, quantum key distribution is, in practice, limited to a distance of a few hundred kilometres, and can only be extended to longer distances by use of a quantum repeater, a device that performs entanglement distillation and quantum teleportation. The existence of noisy entangled states that are undistillable but nevertheless useful for quantum key distribution raises the question of the feasibility of a quantum key repeater, which would work beyond the limits of entanglement distillation, hence possibly tolerating higher noise levels than existing protocols. Here we exhibit fundamental limits on such a device in the form of bounds on the rate at which it may extract secure key. As a consequence, we give examples of states suitable for quantum key distribution but unsuitable for the most general quantum key repeater protocol.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042484023&doi=10.1109%2fCC.2018.8300270&partnerID=40&md5=d5b7e84d8a39efa5a9e4a93a15470c38,Article,6,0.804571152,0,0,0,0.244464463,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.043393167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07203311,0,0,0,0,0.216528321,0,0,0,0.343760716,0,0.50706773,0,0,0.091252153,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.471947611,0,0,0,0.125919126,0,0,0,0.06910995,0,0,0,0,0.109569142,0,0,0,0,0,0.171465955,0,0.104802051,0,0,0,0,0.051140498,0,0,0.167384087,0,0,0,0,0.408029607,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09893465,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.296802338,0.367241334

Currently, it may be limited due to the presence of last-mile copper wire connections. However, in near future, it is envisaged that FTTH connections will exist, and a key offering would be the possibility of optical encryption that can best be implemented using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). However, it is very important that the QKD infrastructure is compatible with the already existing networks for a smooth transition and integration with the classical data traffic. In this paper, we report the feasibility of using off-the-shelf telecommunication components to enable high performance Continuous Variable-Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) systems that can yield secure key rates in the range of 100Mbits/s under practical operating conditions. Multilevel phase modulated signals (m-PSK) are evaluated in terms of secure key rates and transmission distances. The traditional receiver is discussed, aided by the phase noise cancellation based digital signal processing module for detecting the complex quantum signals. Furthermore, we have discussed the compatibility of multiplexers and demultiplexers for wavelength division multiplexed Quantum-to-the-Home (QTTH) network and the impact of splitting ratio is analyzed.

Along with this trend, there emerge quantum neural architectures based on different designs of quantum neurons. A fundamental question in quantum deep learning arises: what is the best quantum neural architecture? Inspired by the design of neural architectures for classical computing which typically employs multiple types of neurons, this paper makes the very first attempt to mix quantum neuron designs to build quantum neural architectures. We observe that the existing quantum neuron designs may be quite different but complementary, such as neurons from variational quantum circuits (VQC) and Quantumflow. More specifically, VQC can apply real-valued weights but suffer from being extended to multiple layers, while QuantumFlow can build a multi-layer network efficiently, but is limited to use binary weights. To take their respective advantages, we propose to mix them together and figure out a way to connect them seamlessly without additional costly measurement. We further investigate the design principles to mix quantum neurons, which can provide guidance for quantum neural architecture exploration in the future. Experimental results demonstrate that the identified quantum neural architectures with mixed quantum neurons can achieve 90.62% of accuracy on the MNIST dataset, compared with 52.77% and 69.92% on the VQC and QuantumFlow, respectively.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072669688&doi=10.1117%2f12.2535988&partnerID=40&md5=bf9d101314032747410a87cc3c2508e3,Conference Paper,3,0.792090237,0.742072007,0,0,0.100842899,0,0,0,0.082556738,0,0,0,0.50248683,0,0,0,0,0,0.031081069,0,0.07957572,0,0.090124573,0.12691365,0,0.069788816,0,0.180791429,0,0,0,0.069788816,0,0,0.097960871,0,0,0.028644411,0,0,0,0.058669012,0,0,0,0.099223134,0,0,0,0.203676404,0.097340457,0,0,0.100515101,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.045689841,0,0.059436941,0,0,0,0.057611641,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026821277,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.107104795,0,0,0,0,0,3.058716435,0.301028474

In this study, we propose an efficient semi-quantum key distribution protocol that allows Alice and quantum-capable restricted Bob to establish a secure key. Then, we demonstrate that the protocol is information-theoretic secure in the asymptotic scenario. As long as the channel noise is less than the noise tolerance of the protocol, Alice and Bob can withdraw a secure key. The proposed protocol has advantages over previous protocols regarding qubit efficiency and communication cost. Besides, our efficiency analysis is more fair and practical because noise factors are taken into account. Based on these features, it may have potential applications in future quantum communications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065311899&partnerID=40&md5=55ef3d4fe6b8c77c6dbc31c9bc4ff2ab,Conference Paper,6,0.811076045,0,0.125689167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.142210937,0.050979931,0,0,0,0,0,0.091543221,0.044260291,0,0,0.126940826,0,0,0,0.099381179,0,0,0,0,0.161545226,0.397524715,0,0,0,0,0,0.040790424,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.094986003,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.136877892,0,0.128725964,0,0,0,0,0.130127161,0.705056369,0.084639826,0,0,0,0,0,0.240327151,0,0,0,0.124948046,0,0,0,0.239684293,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.145020378,0.147934543,0,0,3.459193538,0.412403125

(2020),2020,End-to-End Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) from Metro to Access Networks,2020 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE DESIGN OF RELIABLE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS DRCN 2020,,"Derived from quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution (QKD) can deliver secret keys between two users to secure communication under a certain scale. Nowadays, QKD integrated in backbone, metro, and access areas has been respectively studied and tested around the world. Although the experiments in various scenarios can verify the feasibility of QKD, the situation of QKD between two end users from metro to access networks has not been considered up to now. In this paper, we propose a QKD Network (QKDN) architecture for end-to-end QKD from metro to access networks in a costefficient manner. The cost efficiency can be achieved by sharing Quantum Receivers (Qrecs) in the metro network with the Quantum Transmitters (Qtras) in various access networks since the distance between any two end users within a metro network permits to distribute quantum keys. Under such an architecture, an end-to-end QKD scheme is designed to provide secret keys for end users in different access networks, by mapping Qrecs and allocating time slots according to security requests. Through the end-to-end QKD scheme, the occupation of Qrecs and time slots can be appropriately improved. To verify the effectiveness of the scheme, simulation is conducted on two different topologies respectively. Performances are evaluated in terms of three parameters: i) the failure ratio of end-to-end QKD (FQ), ii) the utilization ratio of time slots (TU), and iii) the utilization ratio of Qrecs (QU). Simulation results show that the topology with more nodes will lower the QU by distributing requests to more numbers of Qrecs. Moreover, the topology with bigger node connectivity can lower FQ since a shorter path will be selected to save the unnecessary occupation of link resources for other end-to-end requests.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063497935&doi=10.1109%2fGLOCOM.2018.8647658&partnerID=40&md5=95afd61a731d4febabbf94ce160b1070,Conference Paper,6,0.816274107,0.180224501,0,0.081195331,0,0,0,0,0.070175958,0,0,0,0.071188405,0,0,0.075698167,0,0,0,0,0,0.02525792,0,0,0,0,0,0.153678695,0,0,0.192859768,0.059322803,0,0.077537694,0,0.063993892,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.076839347,0,0,0,0.089200066,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.048465867,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038837876,0,0.050523366,0,0,0,0.048971801,0.215419756,0.071728271,0,0.150946484,0,0.074584225,0,0,0.082221129,0.178841006,0,0,0.18239178,0,0.063297283,0,0.191456289,0,0,0,0.091042619,0.799439972,0.08656584,0,0,0,3.591906113,0.449311145

One of the notable examples is the introduction of IoT-based smart home services (SHS), which aims to provide ubiquitous sensing and intelligent control at home. Security is an important issue in SHS that needs to be resolved before it can receive wide adoption. In this paper, we propose BC-SHS, a consortium blockchain to protect the IoT-based SHS. The SHS within a community forms a consortium blockchain, while the cloud service provider (CSP) joins the consortium blockchain to provide services through smart contracts. External communication (between smart homes and cloud servers) goes through this consortium blockchain, which ensures integrity, authenticity, auditability and privacy preservation of SHSs. In addition to this, we analyse state of the art post-quantum signature schemes and propose to adopt pqNTRUsign as a replacement to the existing ECDSA signature scheme.

Our every-day secure communication infrastructure relies heavily on public key cryptography; unfortunately, many public key schemes are in fact insecure against quantum algorithms. Furthermore, adversaries who, today, capture information encrypted using classical key distribution systems, can wait and, as soon as quantum computers of sufficient power become available, they may decipher all previously captured information. While some new post-quantum public key systems are assumed to be secure against quantum computers, this is only an assumption and, even if the assumption remains valid, still results in systems that are less efficient for end-users than the more commonly used public key systems employed today. While the advent of quantum technology may seem detrimental to security, in fact, one may harness the power of quantum through quantum key distribution (QKD) for stronger security guarantees. Such QKD protocols allow two (or more) parties to establish a shared secret key, secure against an all-powerful adversary. Perhaps surprising is that QKD technology is already here both experimentally and commercially. This tutorial serves as an introduction to basic QKD along with QKD technology from a practical perspective.

In this regard, in this paper a new lightweight image encryption scheme based on QW for secure data transfer in the internet of things platforms and wireless networking with edge computing is proposed. The introduced approach utilises the power of nonlinear dynamic behaviour of QW to construct permutation boxes and generates pseudo-random numbers for encrypting the plain image after dividing it into blocks. The results of the conducted simulation and numerical analyses confirm that the presented encryption algorithm is effective. The encrypted images have randomness properties, no useful data about the ciphered image can be obtained via analysing the correlation of adjacent pixels. Moreover, the entropy value is close to 8, the number of the pixel change rate is greater than 99.61% and there is high sensitivity of the key parameters with large key space to resist various attacks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049670057&doi=10.1117%2f12.2295016&partnerID=40&md5=be269aa5af69130ced837e19f68c616e,Conference Paper,3,0.854052246,0,0,0,0,0.127731429,0,0,0,0.0794172,0,0,0,0,0,0.126971379,0,0.091656691,0.044315153,0,0,0.042366057,0,0.180952519,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.040840984,0.219459829,0.125102922,0,0,0.134925892,0,0,0,0,0,0.148614958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.274095111,0.27669743,0,0.192745125,0,0,0,0.065144229,0,0.169489478,0.123278024,0.134508373,0.215268433,0.082142241,0.120443882,0.421093827,0,0.126594103,0,0,0,0.232754121,0,0.179986041,0,0,0.076483146,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.296235823,0.305418409,0,0,0,0.145200135,0,4.799932944,0.785269345

However, some vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services need secure transmissions and should be prevented from eavesdropping. Physical layer security, an information- theoretical framework, utilizes the randomness of underlying channels to ensure secrecy in the physical layer. Different from ground communications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) create line-of-sight connections to vehicles and mobile users making them an ideal platform to conduct physical layer security strategies. In this article, we embrace UAV to V2X communications to enhance the V2X security from the physical layer security's perspective.

Time series prediction plays a vital role in protecting the environment and improving the level of intelligence and technology in cities, for example prediction of air pollution, water levels, palm oil prices, financial data and grid security. We describe a new algorithm, Error-output Recurrent Two-layer Extreme Learning Machine or ERT-ELM: it applied a new recurrent technique, that not only removed the restriction of the prediction horizon problem, but it also used a mean squared error of the current step to update the output weights for the next step. This technique avoided error accumulation in the original recurrent algorithm for multi-step time series prediction. Moreover, the new two-layer structure network improved forecasting compared to conventional single-layer or two-layer ELM models. Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization was used to find suitable ERT-ELM parameters. The ability of our model was assessed on ten data sets-two artificial and eight real-world data sets and performed significantly better than the baselines. Especially for the synthetic data sets, in 1-18 prediction periods, our model achieved mean square errors of 2.64 x 10(-3) on the Mackey-Glass data set and 1.49 x 10(-4) on the Lorenz data sets.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041193701&doi=10.1109%2fNANO.2017.8117397&partnerID=40&md5=7b03dfef2b7355700883bdcc49c83f52,Conference Paper,2,0.823973954,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.149178426,0.146634227,0.197865967,0,0,0,0,0.196332191,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.160075936,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.321115054,0,0,0,0,0,0.361762502,0,0,0,0,0.184516034,0,0,0.158645268,0.101270508,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.142536058,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.074938909,0.192889405,0,0,0,0.364155711,0.193300356,0,0,0,0.392480726,0.047638961,0,0,0,0.400052178,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.785388417,0.503119525

Production of such states can occur through photonic subtraction processes either at the transmitter side prior to sending a state through the channel, or at the receiver side on receipt of a state that has traversed the channel. In the context of quantum protocols implemented over communication channels to and from Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites it is unclear what photonic subtraction set-up will provide for the best performance. In this work we show that for a popular version of continuous variable Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) between terrestrial stations and LEO satellites, photon subtraction at the transmitter side is the preferred set-up.

However, the training task of QNNs is challenging and much less understood. We conduct a quantitative investigation on the landscape of loss functions of QNNs and identify a class of simple yet extremely hard QNN instances for training. Specifically, we show for typical under-parameterized QNNs, there exists a dataset that induces a loss function with the number of spurious local minima depending exponentially on the number of parameters. Moreover, we show the optimality of our construction by providing an almost matching upper bound on such dependence. While local minima in classical neural networks are due to non-linear activations, in quantum neural networks local minima appear as a result of the quantum interference phenomenon. Finally, we empirically confirm that our constructions can indeed be hard instances in practice with typical gradient-based optimizers, which demonstrates the practical value of our findings.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029853365&doi=10.1364%2fOPTICA.4.001016&partnerID=40&md5=aa9524a2f5316501e374919a0166ea1d,Article,1,0.839142978,0,0,0,0.176941735,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.062815366,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.054535702,0.164511006,0.279251512,0,0,0,0,0.122453384,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.132095389,0.375858063,0,0,0.153955822,0,0.102942268,0.166044295,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.187284617,0,0,0,0,0.313443486,0,0,0,0,0,0.317221633,0,0,0,0.18988855,0,0,0.104289698,0,0,0,0.101086977,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.169719822,0,0,0,0.235306764,0,0.261314915,0,0,0,0.19055068,0,0.375858063,0,0,0,0,0,4.237369746,0.628817754

In this paper, a plug-and-play measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) scheme with MRR is proposed not only to eliminate detector side channels and allow an untrusted satellite relay between two users, but also to simplify the requirements set-ups in practical flexible moving scenarios. The plug-and-play architecture compensates for the polarization drift during the transmission to provide superior performance in implementing the MDI-QKD on a free-space channel, and the MRR device is adopted to relax the requirements on both communication terminals. A double-pass correlated turbulent channel model is presented to investigate the complex and unstable channel characteristics caused by the atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, the security of the modified MDI-QKD scheme is analyzed under some classical attacks and the simulation results indicate the feasibility under the situation that the system performance deteriorates with the increase of fading correlation coefficient and the turbulence intensity, which provides a meaningful step towards an MDI-QKD based on the moving platforms to join a dynamic quantum network with untrusted relays.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028596121&doi=10.1109%2fLISAT.2017.8001970&partnerID=40&md5=369ec60c3d68725b50f527bb90a03f99,Conference Paper,6,0.843759418,0.123478879,0.514036797,0,0,0,0.126494083,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.036202671,0,0.09268837,0.069220769,0,0,0,0,0.312111821,0,0,0,0.132135796,0,0,0,0,0.087689454,0,0,0,0,0,0.068336612,0,0,0,0.115573326,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23415637,0.121002948,0,0,0,0.132823471,0,0,0,0.113022133,0.105291305,0.078730277,0,0,0,0.053218707,0,0.138462164,0,0,0.263791003,0.067105006,0.196790039,0.049143853,0,0.10341936,0,0,0,0,0,0.098024793,0,0.085794395,0.031240942,0,0,0.052521278,0,0,0,0,0,0.43818216,0,0,0.237238619,0.12305951,4.400986908,0.674320491

An access network that connects multiple end users with one network backbone can be combined with QKD to build security for end users in a scalable and cost-effective way. In this paper, we show that a downstream-access network can be implemented using continuous-variable (CV) QKD. The security analysis is conducted independently with other network nodes, which greatly relax the trustfulness requirement on the network nodes. The security is then obtained against other network parties even when the quantum signals are broadcast throughout the network. The passive beam splitter is sufficient to deterministically distribute the quantum signals, and standard CV QKD systems can be directly fitted in the downstream-access network, which makes it more applicable for practical implementations. Numerous simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the CV QKD downstream-access network, where up to 64 end users are shown to be feasible to access the network. We provide the security-analysis framework for realizing CV QKD in the downstream-access network, which will boost the diversity for constructing practical CV QKD networks.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053100015&doi=10.1201%2f9781315153063&partnerID=40&md5=815a192c746dc08d7241186eb688d158,Book Chapter,6,0.806347787,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.214155251,0.038385303,0,0,0,0.095484655,0,0.068927404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.074828989,0,0,0.112515769,0,0.24327073,0,0,0,0,0.080721039,0,0.030713121,0,0,0,0.125812217,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.061134196,0,0,0,0,0.193848248,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.127458995,0,0,0.080942777,0.061772374,0,0.271431241,0,0.095200937,0,0,0,0,0,0.13535259,0,0,0.402616462,0,0.079842346,0.048347571,0,0,0,0,0,0.705882015,0,0,0,0,3.34864423,0.381658819

Parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative (e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a PQC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a PQC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time.

It, how-ever, introduces a fundamental loss, which increases with the dimension and limits its application over long distances. Here solve this long-standing hurdle by using a few-mode-fiber space-division-multiplexing platform working with orbital-angular-momentum modes. In our scheme, we maintain the practicability provided by the time-bin scheme, while the quantum states are transmitted through a few-mode fiber in a configuration that does not introduce postselection losses.

Recent experiments have demonstrated high-quality control over multi-qubit systems(3-8), elementary quantum algorithms(8-11) and non-fault-tolerant error correction(12-14). Large-scale systems will require using error-corrected logical qubits that are operated fault tolerantly, so that reliable computation becomes possible despite noisy operations(15-18). Overcoming imperfections in this way remains an important outstanding challenge for quantum science(15,19-27). Here, we demonstrate fault-tolerant operations on a logical qubit using spin qubits in diamond. Our approach is based on the five-qubit code with a recently discovered flag protocol that enables fault tolerance using a total of seven qubits(28-30).We encode the logical qubit using a new protocol based on repeated multi-qubit measurements and show that it outperforms non-fault-tolerant encoding schemes. We then fault-tolerantly manipulate the logical qubit through a complete set of single-qubit Clifford gates. Finally, we demonstrate flagged stabilizer measurements with real-time processing of the outcomes. Such measurements are a primitive for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. Although future improvements in fidelity and the number of qubits will be required to suppress logical error rates below the physical error rates, our realization of fault-tolerant protocols on the logical-qubit level is a key step towards quantum information processing based on solid-state spins.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013399215&doi=10.1088%2f1674-1056%2f26%2f1%2f010302&partnerID=40&md5=1f677416a067b79e3031703cc1144d8f,Article,6,0.852577448,0,0,0,0,0.115722138,0,0,0,0.071950406,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.083039142,0.120445944,0.121111385,0,0,0,0.109292925,0,0.270446934,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.117828955,0,0,0,0.037001121,0,0,0,0,0.122240178,0.116767724,0,0,0.0861621,0,0.1346422,0,0,0,0,0.389518009,0,0.467070896,0,0,0,0,0.124946065,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.139794084,0,0.274096644,0,0.223374881,0.243723828,0.195028925,0,0.109119765,0,0,0,0.178381054,0,0,0,0,0.054354593,0,0,0.034646105,0.210869113,0.096188736,0.116491862,0.096981194,0,0.140281538,0,0.138351506,0,0,0,0,0,4.73986995,0.768565531

Teleportation is a costly protocol (it requires sharing entanglement between two partitions), and the number of teleportations required for implement a given distributed circuit is called teleportation cost. It is desirable to distribute a quantum computation in such a way that the teleportation cost is reduced.

The approach taken up by us is a two tire one with initial good quality pre-optimized structures being found out by exploring a suitably constructed empirical potential energy surface and using the stochastic optimizer simulated annealing to explore the surface. These structures are then further refined using quantum chemical calculation to obtain the final structure and the IR spectra. We clearly show that the initial pre-optimization can indeed pave the way for quick and better convergence on subsequent quantum chemical refinement. To give credence to our effort we have also shown the evolutionary trend in vertical detachment energy (VDE) as a function of cluster size.,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992690854&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.94.042340&partnerID=40&md5=3398d555d092f293dffed63d3740f507,Article,1,0.776366055,0,0,0,0,0.441614008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.073237435,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26398563,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6604454,0,0,0,0.236911623,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.218840928,0,0.216263152,0,0,0,0,0.193950801,0,0,0,0.183535726,0,0,0,0.267668284,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.756452988,0.216967524

In early 2020, they specified 6G basic concepts, perspectives, proposals and suggestions in a number of white papers, including the one about 6G trust, security and privacy (TSP) [1]. 6G is expected to offer the 6th sense. It follows the footsteps of 5G and pursues the integration of communications and sensing. Through sensing the physical world and human-beings, 6G should be capable of programming to offer automation systems that span a rich variety of devices, several types of network and communication technologies and humans. Thus theoretically, 6G should timely offer user expected and satisfied networking services for social communications, health, logistic, entertainment, business, and so on. It will embrace emerging technologies, such as quantum communication, molecular communication, real-time intelligent edge, Internet of everything, etc. As a consequence, personal and national safety will highly depend on network and information security. Anticipating future development, ITU-T specifies that Trustworthy Networking should be provided [2]. 6G TSP white paper [1] also indicates that trust should be embedded into networking. On the other hand, security is always a mandatory requirement, which is one of key performance indicators of trust. But sensing human-beings and physical world brings serious concern on privacy preservation, which however, conflicts with trust. All above drives us to pursue a trust management solution for trustworthy networking in 6G, which should ensure security and overcome privacy leakage in an integrated way.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989869422&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.94.032305&partnerID=40&md5=ea460b116e44086192be4a8a0d572d7d,Article,3,0.839133739,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.099009546,0,0,0.115161221,0,0,0,0.266152249,0,0,0,0,0.160008361,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.051314285,0,0.157184435,0,0,0,0,0.169001828,0,0.119492235,0.375973926,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.102140632,0,0.346558047,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.081849877,0,0.106476761,0,0,0.135236038,0,0,0.37791395,0,0,0,0,0,0.292441811,0,0.075380611,0,0,0.28828967,0,0,0.080777238,0.268992971,0,0,0.18610141,0.191870099,0,0,0.18610141,0,0,4.233428613,0.627721705

QKD protocol is implemented by using subcarrier intensity modulation, where binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signaling is used for encoding and direct detection with a dual-threshold receiver is employed for decoding.

Our central thesis is that various versions of Moore's Laws will all unavoidably break down over the next two to three decades, due to fundamental limitations imposed by the laws of physics (especially quantum mechanics). Therefore, the end to scaling-up von Neumann-based architectures by adding more cores and other incremental technology advancements is within sight. How are these challenges to be overcome, in order to continue making computation faster, cheaper, more energy efficient and more reliable? One possible answer lies in connectionist massively parallel models, based on (artificial) neural networks and other paradigms from biology, neuroscience and statistical physics. We discuss what would such massively parallel connectionist computers be like if they were to be based on implementing neural networks in the hardware, and undertake several thought experiments comparing and contrasting the hypothetical connectionist parallel machines with the classical multicore supercomputers and large-scale distributed computing systems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977534213&doi=10.1038%2fsrep28813&partnerID=40&md5=6aa4024adab114c8ddf5194ba2664bf3,Article,3,0.826426029,0.40747959,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.179202912,0.180192974,0.152935544,0,0.173209247,0.406522831,0,0,0,0,0,0.377742002,0.109011842,0.134126221,0,0.175309281,0,0,0,0.110102646,0,0,0,0.112755213,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.200324507,0,0.187077362,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.37179664,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10457977,0,0,0,0.283121011,0.103094928,0,0,0.086659958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.855244479,0.522546839

We also show that any code attempting to exceed this upper bound must incur large error in decoding, which can be viewed as a weaker version of the strong converse results for quantum capacity. As an application, we find nearly matching upper and lower bounds (up to an additive constant) on the quantum capacity of quantum expander channels. Using these techniques, we further conclude that the 'mixture of random unitaries' channels arising in the construction of quantum expanders in [Hastings 2007] show a trend in multiplicativity of output 2-norm similar to that exhibited in [Montanaro 2013] for output infinity-norm of random quantum channels.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84973882724&doi=10.1063%2f1.4953785&partnerID=40&md5=c5a5553e7a66b5c4479b00ddef738076,Article,6,0.715434551,0,0.900387109,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.060866652,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.177216726,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.151859783,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.097950968,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.174290125,0,0.164454625,0,0,0,0,0,0.253208174,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.980234162,0.001097253

There are already some proposals of application of the quantum algorithm to practical problems, including quantitative finance. In many problems in finance to which Monte Carlo simulation is applied, many random numbers are required to obtain one sample value of the integrand, since those problems are extremely high-dimensional integrations, for example, risk measurement of credit portfolio. This leads to the situation that the required qubit number is too large in the naive implementation where a quantum register is allocated per random number. In this paper, we point out that we can reduce qubits keeping quantum speed up if we perform calculation similar to the classical one, that is, estimate the average of integrand values sampled by a pseudo-random-number generator (PRNG) implemented on a quantum circuit. We present not only the overview of the idea but also concrete implementation of PRNG and application to credit risk measurement. Actually, reduction of qubits is a trade-off against increase of circuit depth. Therefore, full reduction might be impractical, but such a trade-off between speed and memory space will be important in adjustment of calculation setting considering machine specs, if large-scale Monte Carlo simulation by quantum computer is in operation in the future.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961838397&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.93.032319&partnerID=40&md5=d341b3b8bad992870f15d3b001332779,Article,1,0.83708173,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12249879,0,0.078732575,0,0,0,0,0,0.070688929,0,0,0.175006468,0,0.099102987,0.093038051,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.031498033,0.169255295,0,0,0.193541256,0.104059689,0,0.103737684,0.109107968,0,0.11539125,0.229234378,0,0,0,0.234741929,0.221057287,0.114233849,0.09940114,0,0,0.062696556,0,0,0,0,0.09940114,0.074325979,0.264732155,0,0,0.050241567,0,0,0,0,0.16602274,0,0,0,0,0.390535659,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.588874091,0,0,0,0.111983555,0,4.173141,0.610955424

In this way, we establish color codes as providing a natural setting in which advantages offered by topological hardware can be combined with those arising from topological error-correcting software for full-fledged fault-tolerant quantum computing. We provide a complete description of our architecture, including the underlying physical ingredients. We start by showing that in topological superconductor networks, hexagonal cells can be employed to serve as physical qubits for universal quantum computation, and we present protocols for realizing topologically protected Clifford gates. These hexagonal-cell qubits allow for a direct implementation of open-boundary color codes with ancilla-free syndrome read-out and logical T gates via magic-state distillation. For concreteness, we describe how the necessary operations can be implemented using networks of Majorana Cooper pair boxes, and we give a feasibility estimate for error correction in this architecture.

911,1,C7,Fontana et al. (2022),2022,Non-trivial symmetries in quantum landscapes and their resilience to quantum noise,QUANTUM,,"Very little is known about the cost landscape for Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Nevertheless, PQCs are employed in Quan-tum Neural Networks and Variational Quan-tum Algorithms, which may allow for near-term quantum advantage. Such applications require good optimizers to train PQCs. Re-cent works have focused on quantum-aware op-timizers specifically tailored for PQCs. How-ever, ignorance of the cost landscape could hinder progress towards such optimizers. In this work, we analytically prove two results for PQCs: (1) We find an exponentially large symmetry in PQCs, yielding an exponentially large degeneracy of the minima in the cost landscape. Alternatively, this can be cast as an exponential reduction in the volume of rel-evant hyperparameter space. (2) We study the resilience of the symmetries under noise, and show that while it is conserved under uni-tal noise, non-unital channels can break these symmetries and lift the degeneracy of minima, leading to multiple new local minima. Based on these results, we introduce an optimization method called Symmetry-based Minima Hop-ping (SYMH), which exploits the underlying symmetries in PQCs. Our numerical simula-tions show that SYMH improves the overall optimizer performance in the presence of non-unital noise at a level comparable to current hardware. Overall, this work derives large-scale circuit symmetries from local gate trans-formations, and uses them to construct a noise-aware optimization method.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011026202&doi=10.1117%2f12.2241491&partnerID=40&md5=1445548c657caebaaf12ae3a6f18b9b2,Conference Paper,1,0.812437117,0,0.124168154,0,0,0,0,0.118155482,0,0.078359014,0,0.050363003,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08744936,0,0,0,0.126786761,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.127168201,0,0,0,0,0.439904261,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.628268066,0.080210431,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.150157778,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.106200055,0.16209549,0,0,0,0,0,0.123436001,0,0,0.136074985,0,0.221401668,0,0.037732027,0,0.209512493,0,0,0.344476773,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.143265431,0,3.495185433,0.422412648

They are used to transmit an ever-increasing amount of sensitive health, financial and personal information. This exposes us to the growing scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can provide unconditional and future-proof data security but implementing it for handheld mobile devices comes with specific challenges. To establish security, secret keys of sufficient length need to be transmitted during the time of a handheld transaction (similar to 1s) despite device misalignment, ambient light and user's inevitable hand movements. Transmitters and receivers should ideally be compact and low-cost, while avoiding security loopholes. Here we demonstrate the first QKD transmission from a handheld transmitter with a key-rate large enough to overcome finite key effects. Using dynamic beam-steering, reference-frame-independent encoding and fast indistinguishable pulse generation, we obtain a secret key rate above 30kb/s over a distance of 0.5m.

In the future, as network virtualization technology advances, building and controlling a network for each service is expected to make the network suitable for the service. In this case, it is necessary to design the network construction and operation from the viewpoint of the quality of experience (QoE) of users. Although research on modeling QoE of users has been advanced, the QoE changes according to the user's psychological effect, so it can be hard to model the complete QoE in the conventional model. On the other hand, quantum decision-making has begun to be drawing attention in recent years as a model for expressing human cognitive state and decision-making. In quantum decision-making, it is possible to represent human behavior, which is hard to express in the conventional cognitive model, and it is expected as a more general model. In this paper, we implement the recommendation algorithm in MPEG-DASH, which recommends the user to select the appropriate bitrate by avoiding the cognitive bias captured by the quantum decision-making model.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976589855&doi=10.1117%2f12.2218282&partnerID=40&md5=d919ff9d7cb201e1f47e70a51c186bfc,Conference Paper,2,0.78315568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.091141886,0,0,0.137035526,0,0,0.145716682,0,0,0.05085758,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.149257716,0,0,0,0.046870506,0,0,0,0.191998797,0,0,0.154366394,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14791342,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.097255951,0,0.154366394,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1129805,0,0,0.089038855,0,0,0.128759696,0.843668873,0.17554933,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.169985164,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.886763269,0.253207454

The output power of the OFC is very stable, with the specially designed circuit and the flatness of the frequency comb over the span of 6 nm, which can be limited to 1.5 dB. Four channel wavelengths are chosen to demonstrate one-to-many channels for FSO communication, like optical wireless broadcast. The outdoor experiment is established to test the bit error rate (BER) and eye diagrams with 12.5 Gb/s on-off keying (OOK). The indoor experiment is used to test the highest traffic rate, which is up to 21 Gb/s for one-hop FSO communication. To the best of our knowledge, this scheme is the first to propose the realization of one-to-many broadcasting transmission for FSO communication based on the OFC module. The advantages of integration, miniaturization, channelization, low power consumption, and unlimited bandwidth of one-to-many broadcasting communication scheme, shows promising results on constructing the future space-air-ground-ocean (SAGO) FSO communication networks.

One such encryption scheme, Multi-path Switching with Secret Sharing (MSSS), combines secret sharing with multi-path switching to achieve security as long as the adversary does not have global observability of all paths and thus cannot capture enough shares to reconstruct messages. MSSS assumes that sending a share on a path is an atomic operation and all paths have the same delay. We identify a side-channel vulnerability for MSSS, created by the fact that in real networks, sending a share is not an atomic operation as paths have multiple hops and different delays. This channel, referred to as Network Data Remanence (NDR), is present in all schemes like MSSS whose security relies on transfer atomicity and all paths having the same delay. We demonstrate the presence of NDR in a physical testbed. We then identify two new attacks that aim to exploit the side-channel, referred to as NDR Blind and NDR Planned, propose an analytical model to analyze the attacks, and demonstrate them using an implementation of MSSS based on the ONOS SDN controller. Finally, we present a countermeasure for the attacks and show its effectiveness in simulations and Mininet experiments.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946210939&doi=10.1103%2fPhysRevA.92.042327&partnerID=40&md5=0037d50650f01e7aa31b43b95522cc50,Article,6,0.838958621,0,0.420573604,0,0,0,0,0,0.131127489,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.141446029,0,0,0.098734099,0,0,0.047195759,0,0.067193661,0,0.221695588,0,0.143578384,0,0,0,0,0,0.144883282,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.093185855,0,0,0,0.157599256,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.287156769,0,0,0,0,0.153634528,0,0,0.143578384,0.214717937,0.127462707,0.169534609,0,0.072570626,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.536697608,0.201042101,0,0.141025744,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.116991813,0.127803258,0,0.118274321,0,0,0,0.172491129,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.250194541,0.632384392

(2022),2022,Note about Passive Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution over Turbulent Atmospheric Channel,SYMMETRY-BASEL,10.3390/sym14102128,"Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has been implemented over the atmospheric channels over free space. However, atmospheric turbulence weakens the quality of the transmitting quantum signals and hence decreases the secret key rate of the system. Here, we suggest an atmospheric turbulence channel model that involves atmospheric turbulence bubbles and demonstrates the implementation feasibility of passive CVQKD with spectrum resources in the terahertz band over the atmospheric turbulence channel. We achieve the channel transmittance characterized by the refractive index and the wavefront distortions. Moreover, an adaptive optics (AO) unit is used for performance improvement while considering the effect of the thermal noise and excess noise on the atmospheric turbulence bubble-modeled channel. Numerical simulations show that the AO-involved detection scheme can result in reductions in excess noise when being faced with the floating clouds and mist in atmospheric turbulence, which results in performance improvements in terms of secret key rate, which confirms the utility of the high-rate and long-distance CVQKD in terahertz (THz) for practical implementations.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942569330&doi=10.1088%2f0253-6102%2f64%2f3%2f287&partnerID=40&md5=bdd83db1a9baf93f53a4c84fd69f12dc,Article,6,0.828020334,0,0.68011794,0,0,0,0,0,0.106024436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.114367593,0,0.08255841,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.089627086,0,0,0,0,0.145689839,0,0,0,0,0.096684341,0,0,0,0.112684609,0,0.226039049,0,0.232183461,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.113018007,0,0.146448052,0,0,0,0,0.11609173,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.333122574,0,0,0.14797682,0.108488047,0,0,0.114027767,0,0,0,0,0.124222725,0.216159689,0,0.189189787,0,0,0.095631879,0.057908733,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.130786876,0,0.130786876,0,3.909836326,0.5377291

Specifically, 3D architectures are currently attracting increasing attention in various fields due to their intriguing properties, while CdS has been most widely utilized for PEC bioanalysis applications because of its narrow band gap, proper conduction band, and stable photocurrent generation. Using CdS as a representative material, this work realized the innovative synthesis of 3D CdS@CF networks via a simple solvothermal process. Exemplified by the sandwich immunoassay of fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP), the as fabricated 3D CdS@CF networks exhibited superior properties, and the assay demonstrated good performance in terms of sensitivity and selectivity. This work features a novel fabrication of 3D CdS@CF networks that can serve as a general platform for PEC bioanalysis. The methodology reported here is expected to inspire new interest for the fabrication of other 3D nanostructured Cd-chalcogenide (S, Se, Te)@CF networks for wide applications in biomolecular detection and beyond.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84934840075&doi=10.1080%2f09500340.2015.1021725&partnerID=40&md5=7005594313047d8ae2489b19935710c0,Article,2,0.809817672,0.275269507,0,0,0,0,0,0.218088761,0,0,0,0.371835645,0,0,0,0,0.277157888,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.181215745,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19548471,0,0,0.199838352,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.257645783,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.148050629,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.251164182,0,0,0,0.417869616,0.211942522,0,0,0,0.423885044,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.429448384,0.404130852

Further as a user/developer we always concern with strong end-to-end security which transport layer provides. Major security issues occur due to lack of mutual authentication, improper or miss configuration of server and client, weak authentication, selection of weak cipher suit, weak key exchange technique, & weak hash algorithm. We have lots of research and solutions for above problems but majority required considerable amount of change in existing environment and/or complex and costly so never used in practical life. Thus in our solution we focus on easy to use, easy adaptable, flexible, mutual authentication based low cost practical solutions based on S-aePAKE. Our proposed technique is a based on augmented PAKE (server cannot see and store plain text password - resist server compromise attack) with ephemeral keying material (for forward secrecy), Oblivious PRF (to make password pseudorandom) and blinded DH with future safe authenticated encryption, and memory hard new hash algorithm (makes offline and online password attack infeasible). We can use it with TLS/SSL or without it. We can further use two factor authentications with S-aePAKE to make it more secure.

In particular, quantum annealers. There exist a plethora of algorithms promising to outperform classical computers in the near-term future. Here, we propose a parallel in time approach to simulate dynamical systems designed to be executed already on present-day quantum annealers. In essence, purely classical methods for solving dynamics systems are serial. Therefore, their parallelization is substantially limited. In the presented approach, however, the time evolution is rephrased as a ground-state search of a classical Ising model. Such a problem is solved intrinsically in parallel by quantum computers.

Subsequently, we propose a protocol, which can operate over large distances, and offers security against both classical and quantum adversaries.

However, a suitable channel model for implementing the indoor CVQKD system has not been considered before. Here, we establish an indoor channel model to show the feasibility of CVQKD in terahertz (THz) band. We adopt both active and passive state preparation schemes to demonstrate the performance of the indoor CVQKD system involving multi-path propagation. We achieve the channel transmittance characterized by frequency, water-vapor density, antenna gain, reflection loss and the surrounding itself. The ray-tracing based numerical simulations show that the multi-path propagation can degrade the performance of the indoor CVQKD system. The maximum transmission distance is two meters at 410 GHz for both active and passive state preparations, and it can be extended to 35 and 20 meters respectively by using high gain antenna to combat the multi-path propagation.

Information theoretic security is increasingly important because of the threat of quantum computers that can effectively break algorithms and protocols that are used in today's public key infrastructure. We consider interactive protocols for wiretap II channel with active adversary who can eavesdrop and add adversarial noise to the eavesdropped part of the codeword. These channels capture wireless setting where malicious eavesdroppers at reception distance of the transmitter can eavesdrop the communication and introduce jamming signal to the channel. We derive a new upperbound R <= 1 - rho for the rate of interactive protocols over two-way wiretap II channel with active adversaries, and construct a perfectly secure protocol family with achievable rate 1 - 2 rho + rho(2). This is strictly higher than the rate of the best one round protocol which is 1 - 2 rho, hence showing that interaction improves rate. We also prove that even with interaction, reliable communication is possible only if rho < 1/2. An interesting aspect of this work is that our bounds will also hold in network setting when two nodes are connected by n paths, a rho of which is corrupted by the adversary.

(2019),2019,A Novel Quantum Visual Secret Sharing Scheme,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931073,"Inspired by Naor et al.'s visual secret sharing (VSS) scheme, a novel n out of n quantum visual secret sharing (QVSS) scheme is proposed, which consists of two phases: sharing process and recovering process. In the first process, the color information of each pixel from the original secret image is encoded into an n-qubit superposition state by using the strategy of quantum expansion instead of classical pixel expansion, and then these n qubits are distributed as shares to n participants, respectively. During the recovering process, all participants cooperate to collect these n shares of each pixel together, then perform the corresponding measurement on them, and execute the n-qubit XOR operation to recover each pixel of the secret image. The proposed scheme has the advantage of single-pixel parallel processing that is not available in the existing analogous quantum schemes and perfectly solves the problem that in the classic VSS schemes the recovered image has the loss in resolution. Moreover, its experiment implementation with the IBM Q is conducted to demonstrate the practical feasibility.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qute.201900011,Journal,6,0.7865206,0,0,0,0.137462673,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.216945195,0,0,0,0,0.095131708,0,0,0,0,0.077318832,0,0,0.124341618,0,0.102622399,0,0,0,0,0,0.079973893,0,0,0,0,0.090924467,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.137015839,0,0.123221731,0,0,0.077721222,0,0,0,0,0.123221731,0,0.109390946,0,0,0.124563013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.690906312,0,0,0,0.094120281,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.556310772,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.961192632,0.273906625

With the recent success of space-based experimental QKD systems, researchers are now focussing on implementing more practical and efficient QKD systems that meet the challenges faced in space-based implementations. One pressing problem is the need for efficient and easy to implement reconciliation schemes for practical QKD systems. Rate-adaptive schemes based on LDPC codes constitute an appealing implementation of the key reconciliation process since they cover the entire range of the channel parameter space with a limited set of pre-defined Mother codes. In this paper, we investigate in detail some rate-adaptive reconciliation schemes based on LDPC codes, illustrating how their performance compares to other set-ups in which fixed-rate non-adaptive LDPC codes optimised for different channel conditions are adopted. In particular, the impact rate-adaptive codes have on decoding complexity, and subsequently the overall secure key throughput, is quantified through full blown simulations of an entanglement-based version of the QKD protocol within the context of an entanglement source onboard a satellite. Our work highlights that even though rate-adaptive schemes schemes for QKD reconciliation appear ideal for future space-based implementations of single-photon QKD, identification of ideal Mother codes for such schemes remains to be resolved.",,Journal,6,0.837155998,0,0.144911264,0,0,0.073541771,0.089149345,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.178602117,0.076966654,0,0.048784781,0.073983663,0,0,0,0,0.074206244,0,0,0.04656273,0.1145799,0.171707067,0,0.080416515,0,0,0.023514325,0,0,0,0.240808265,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.079907215,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046805056,0.083053092,0,0,0,0.148412489,0,0.065877108,0,0,0,0.058063084,0,0.354888545,0.077443618,0,0,0.416075658,0.069270312,0,0.072886952,0,0,0,0,0,0.138170037,0,0,0,0.067003982,0,0.1110464,0,0.067003982,0,0,0,0.540431536,0,0,0.334397734,0,4.168471443,0.609656797

The QD-loaded plastic scintillator was measured after setting the distance from the contaminated soil to 20, 50, and 100 mm. As a result, the detection efficiency of the commercial plastic scintillator (EJ-200) was calculated to be 11.81% and that of the QD-loaded plastic scintillator was 15.22%, which proved the higher detection efficiency performance than the commercial plastic scintillator.

To route the secure QKD traffic to the end-users, 1x2, 1x4, 1x8 and 1x12 switching configurations have been analyzed for the transmission distance ranging from 0 to 60 km. We have achieved the secure key rates of 30 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s for the 1x12 and 1x2 switching configurations, respectively. We have also compared the performance of routed QKD traffic with a simple point-to-point QKD system and the classical DV-QKD protocol.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification.

The SNSPD is characterized with a quantum efficiency, dead time, dark count rate and number of channels. The investigation is based on the Poisson channel and well-known Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) deployed as a modulation technique. Moreover, the selected receiver aperture diameter provides the necessary resilience to atmospheric turbulence effect. Addressing the sophisticated parameterization of the current simulations, BER performance of the deep space FSO link based on the SNSPD receiver is provided.

To solve this problem, a technology forCV-BSM of remote independent quantum states is developed that consists of optical phase locking, phase estimation, real-time phase feedback, and quadrature remapping in the present work. With this technology, CV-BSM is accurately implemented, and the firstCV-MDI-QKDover optical fiber is demonstrated, to our knowledge. The achieved secret key rates are 0.43 (0.19) bits per pulse over a 5-km (10-km) optical fiber. Our work shows that it is feasible to build a CV-MDI-QKD system over optical fiber. Further, the results pave the way towards realization of a high secret key rate and low-cost metropolitan MDI-QKD network, and serve as a stepping stone to a CV quantum repeater.

QCA designs, which are best suited to replace CMOS technique, are more interesting among the other techniques because of its attractive features of high speed operation, ultra-low power consumption and small dimension utilizing very less overall area. In this presentation, novel designs and layout of code converters like Binary to Gray and Gray to Binary have been implemented for 4-bit level which are a crucial code converters required at almost all the communication devices. Energy estimation and verification of the outputs for the proposed converter designs have been obtained using QCAPro and QCADesigner tool respectively, which shows the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

(2015),2015,Experimental quantum key distribution with simulated ground-to-satellite photon losses and processing limitations,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,10.1103/PhysRevA.92.052339,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) has the potential to improve communications security by offering cryptographic keys whose security relies on the fundamental properties of quantum physics. The use of a trusted quantum receiver on an orbiting satellite is the most practical near-term solution to the challenge of achieving long-distance (global-scale) QKD, currently limited to a few hundred kilometers on the ground. This scenario presents unique challenges, such as high photon losses and restricted classical data transmission and processing power due to the limitations of a typical satellite platform. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of such a system by implementing a QKD protocol, with optical transmission and full post-processing, in the high-loss regime using minimized computing hardware at the receiver. Employing weak coherent pulses with decoy states, we demonstrate the production of secure key bits at up to 56.5 dB of photon loss. We further illustrate the feasibility of a satellite uplink by generating a secure key while experimentally emulating the varying losses predicted for realistic low-Earth-orbit satellite passes at 600 km altitude. With a 76 MHz source and including finite-size analysis, we extract 3374 bits of a secure key from the best pass. We also illustrate the potential benefit of combining multiple passes together: while one suboptimal upper-quartile pass produces no finite-sized key with our source, the combination of three such passes allows us to extract 165 bits of a secure key. Alternatively, we find that by increasing the signal rate to 300 MHz it would be possible to extract 21 570 bits of a secure finite-sized key in just a single upper-quartile pass.",,Conference Paper,6,0.864089847,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.086613767,0.085136592,0,0.102986056,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.132587204,0,0.193376516,0.082062419,0.030642592,0,0.043626545,0,0.14393936,0,0,0,0,0.116987526,0,0,0,0.202044193,0.155273175,0,0,0.079365632,0,0,0.060502387,0,0.093220532,0.097287436,0.102323805,0,0,0,0,0.301146885,0.104676385,0,0,0,0,0.090752363,0,0,0.313002775,0.099749643,0.198247961,0.100065085,0.093220532,0.069704505,0,0,0,0,0.072940918,0,0.089164731,0,0,0,0,0.304569433,0,0.09156319,0.071204508,0,0,0,0.099749643,0.390541797,0,0,0,0.25251838,0,0.04650015,0,0,0,0,0,0.290961164,0,0.107130966,0,0.21790352,5.213290273,0.90022605

(Phys Rev Lett 99:140501, 2007), involves the use of fully quantum users and semi-quantum, or classical users. These restricted users are only allowed to interact with the quantum channel in a limited manner. Originally introduced to study the key-distribution problem, semi-quantum research has since expanded, and continues to grow, with new protocols, security proof methods, experimental implementations, and new cryptographic applications beyond key distribution. Research in the field of semi-quantum cryptography requires new insights into working with restricted protocols and, so, the tools and techniques derived in this field can translate to results in broader quantum information science. Furthermore, other questions such as the connection between quantum and classical processing, including how classical information processing can be used to counteract a quantum deficiency in a protocol, can shed light on important theoretical questions. This work surveys the history and current state of the art in semi-quantum research. We discuss the model and several protocols offering the reader insight into how protocols are constructed in this realm. We discuss security proof methods and how classical post-processing can be used to counteract users' inability to perform certain quantum operations. Moving beyond key distribution, we survey current work in other semi-quantum cryptographic protocols and current trends. We also survey recent work done in attempting to construct practical semi-quantum systems including recent experimental results in this field.

The development moved from large and costly spacecrafts to cost-efficient designs and shorter development times. While the satellites became smaller, the resolution of high compact sensors increased which led to a high data-volume to be transmitted and increasing demands for higher data rates on small satellites. This motivated for a highly compact version of DLR's optical communication payload OSIRIS for small LEO satellites. DLR's Institute of Communications and Navigation has developed the OSIRIS (Optical Space Infrared Downlink System) program starting with payloads on the satellites Flying Laptop of Univ. of Stuttgart and BiROS of DLR. Combining miniaturization to the flight-proven developments with novel concepts, OSIRIS4CubeSat allows integration in a standard CubeSat bus.

Here in this work, the performances of atmospheric continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD) under diverse weather conditions are analyzed quantitatively. According to the Mie scattering theory and atmospheric CV-MDI-QKD model, we numerically simulate the relationship between performance of CV-MDI-QKD and the rainy and foggy conditions, aiming to get close to the actual combat environment in the future. The results show that both rain and fog will degrade the performance of the CV-MDI-QKD protocol. Under the rainy condition, the larger the raindrop diameter, the more obvious the extinction effect is and the lower the secret key rate accordingly. In addition, we find that the secret key rate decreases with the increase of spot deflection distance and the fluctuation of deflection. Under the foggy condition, the results illustrate that the transmittance decreases with the increase of droplet radius or deflection distance, which eventually yields the decrease in the secret key rate. Besides, in both weather conditions, the increase of transmission distance also leads the secret key rate to deteriorate.

The security of this protocol relies on the estimation of certain detection probabilities (yields) through the decoy-state technique. Analytical bounds on the relevant yields have been recently derived assuming that both parties use the same set of decoy intensities, thus providing sub-optimal key rates in asymmetric-loss scenarios.

The framework combines the existing technologies of the distributed web and distributed ledger to provide a mechanism of encrypting data and choosing whom to share the data with. The framework is designed to work with existing platforms; the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the Ethereum blockchain platforms are used as examples within this paper, though it is stated that similar platforms are capable of providing the requirements for the framework to operate. The framework uses the concept of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE), and is implemented in three different mechanisms of the DHKE: one-step Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH); two-step ECDH; and Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (SIDH). The paper discusses the security of each along with individual advantages and disadvantages, and concludes that the SIDH is the most appropriate implementation for future use due to it being post-quantum secure.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.26.022563,Journal,3,0.830853045,0,0,0,0.428695699,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.178011165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.192141709,0,0.208886914,0.482258201,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.060885477,0,0,0,0.249409262,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.221554224,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.192141709,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.170575135,0,0,0.097116597,0,0.252673824,0,0,0.160460398,0,0,0.179361134,0,0,0.146763332,0,0,0.115662782,0,0.268322032,0,0,0.114020582,0,0,0.095843889,0,0.173492941,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.988277005,0.559543838

The notion of an application or experience is becoming more distributed across devices. No application or experience will be a single device experience; every experience is going to be multi-device and is going to be multi-sense. Every one of these experiences is going to be deeply infused with AI. AI is going to be everywhere: in our networks, in our datacenters, in our devices and in every application. As we have this more complex AI-infused distributed fabric, we need new breakthroughs to manage our complex issues. This is where an event-driven, serverless compute processing will be very important. And this will be distributed from cloud to edge. Quantum computing takes a giant leap forward from today's technology-one that will forever alter our economic, industrial, academic, and societal landscape.

Ten years have passed since 2011. In these ten years, numerous new and promising technologies and applications have been developed. The original concept of Industry 4.0, including the conceptual framework, technology framework, and enabling technologies, has experienced tremendous changes. As such, the new generation of Industry 4.0 emerges, which is also called Industry 5.0. Today, we are on the cusp of the Industry 4.0 evolution supported by a new set of enabling technologies. In such evolution of Industry 4.0, future Industry 4.0 requires a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of the next generation of Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, Quantum Computing, and others. The technologies in the original Industry 4.0 framework, such as Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT, etc., will be affected by Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G/6G, and Quantum Computing.

TESAT's LCTs have successfully accomplished more than 25.000 links in the past six years. In this paper, an overview of the results generated during this time is presented. Eight LCTs 135, 1064 nm wavelength are/have been in operation in the past six years. Two LC Ts are on board of gcostationary satellites (GD)s) and six are/were on board of low-orbit satellites (LE0s) covering wide range of missions from earth observation (e.g. Copernicus program) and surveillance to technology demonstrator payloads (e.g. TDP1 Experimentation Program) [1] [2]. Space to ground links (SGI.$) have been demonstrated using different art of optical ground stations (OGS). Up- and down-optical links with and without communication between the Technology Demonstrator Payload 1 (TDP1) and the DLR Transportable Adaptive Optics Ground Station (T-AOGS) [121 have been used for experimental purpose, contributing to the data generation for atmospheric modelling and supporting the experts in building a better understanding of atmospheric impact onto the optical channel [31. In order to implement and operate the LCTs, new operational concepts have been developed. Generation of operational products like link requests or commanding files has been supported and tuned [51 [21. Further technology applications like airborne terminals are currently under validation. In 2019, several companies have started the verification of their terminals using the E2E test bed TDP1 and the T-AOGS described in [4]. Testing campaigns are ongoing in 2019. The TDP1 test bed has also supported quantum key distribution (QKD) verifications [7] [13] and optical channel characterization [91. Methods for analysis, characterization and assessment of trends and performances of the LCTs in space and OGS have been developed and implemented. The Long Term Performance Analysis (LTPA) enables the assessment of potential degradations and allows for an introduction of corresponding counter measures (i.e. parameter settings modifications) preventing from negative impact on operations and services [61 [10].

An emerging paradigm is to complement the existing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology with new functionalities, rather than finding a drop-in replacement for it. In this article, we discuss such a complementary approach that we call probabilistic spin logic (PSL) based on the concept of a probabilistic or p-bit. p-bits fluctuate between 0 and 1 and can be imagined in between deterministic bits that are either 0 or 1 and quantum bits that are a superposition of 0 and 1. Interconnected circuits built out of p-bits (p-circuits) can be broadly useful for machine learning and quantum computing in the solution of problems that conventional CMOS may not be particularly suited for. Although such p-bits can be implemented using standard CMOS technology, we will show that the inherent physics of nanomagnets can naturally provide an energy efficient and scalable p-bit implementation through the use of low-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). In this article, we provide a general description of p-bits and p-circuits and discuss their applications. We review experimental progress toward constructing p-bits and p-circuits exploiting the inherent stochasticity of nanomagnets, from a physics/device/circuits perspective. In particular, we identify building blocks for write and read operations that can be used in different combinations to construct functional p-bits and p-circuits.

Conceptual skills are being enhanced through the use of interactive mapping techniques connected to online resources. The ability to see connections with data and relate it to trends analysis is a key aspect in utilizing Big Data. Coupled with the rise of Big Data is also the development of faster computing systems which can collate and summarize data queries initiated by the enduser. The age of quantum computers whereby searching techniques will be accelerated beyond current abilities of the processing speeds of traditional digital processors will necessitate different ways to display information and analyze it. Natural language and semantic search strategies, search engine advancements and AI developments are introducing newer approaches to data analysis. By using both search techniques formulated by humans and combining them with results obtained from machine assisted learning a new era of information access has evolved. Finding information using newer cognitive based modeling systems to help retrieve information as well as understanding the growth of data will be outlined. Visual demonstrations of new information modeling systems will be discussed and the implications of accessing data for the eventual solutions to complex problems will also be discussed. The rate of change in knowledge accumulation necessitates that search strategies be fluid and generative in their design rather than static or sequential. Knowledge management also needs to be integrated with a dynamic structure with search strategy designs, which can constantly utilize newer forms of data analysis.

Termed Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, these prototypes are too small for large benchmarks or even for Quantum Error Correction (QEC), but they do have sufficient resources to run small benchmarks, particularly if compiled with optimizations to make use of scarce qubits and limited operation counts and coherence times. QC has not yet, however, settled on a particular preferred device implementation technology, and indeed different NISQ prototypes implement qubits with very different physical approaches and therefore widely-varying device and machine characteristics. Our work performs a full-stack, benchmark-driven hardware-software analysis of QC systems. We evaluate QC architectural possibilities, software-visible gates, and software optimizations to tackle fundamental design questions about gate set choices, communication topology, the factors affecting benchmark performance and compiler optimizations. In order to answer key cross-technology and cross-platform design questions, our work has built the first top-to-bottom toolflow to target different qubit device technologies, including superconducting and trapped ion qubits which are the current QC front-runners. We use our toolflow, TriQ, to conduct real-system measurements on seven running QC prototypes from three different groups, IBM, Rigetti, and University of Maryland. Overall, we demonstrate that leveraging microarchitecture details in the compiler improves program success rate up to 28x on IBM (geomean 3x), 2.3x on Rigetti (geomean 1.45x), and 1.47x on UMDTI (geomean 1.17x), compared to vendor toolflows. In addition, from these real-system experiences at QC's hardware-software interface, we make observations and recommendations about native and software-visible gates for different QC technologies, as well as communication topologies, and the value of noise-aware compilation even on lower-noise platforms. This is the largest cross-platform real-system QC study performed thus far; its results have the potential to inform both QC device and compiler design going forward.",,Conference Paper,3,0.860570073,0.211645512,0,0,0,0.089427797,0,0.083840575,0,0,0.099688657,0,0.334398626,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.059322959,0.089965144,0.126689142,0,0.069665361,0.356644347,0.451179028,0,0,0,0,0,0.091055904,0,0,0,0,0,0.087587517,0,0.117130455,0,0.090235806,0.094172496,0,0.06658438,0,0.10404885,0,0.097168264,0,0,0.100337291,0,0.090235806,0,0.26748326,0.170746761,0,0.096555867,0.095950238,0,0,0,0,0.106548713,0,0,0,0,0.086309862,0.094172496,0,0.057509727,0,0,0,0,0,0.175175034,0,0.21727556,0.096555867,0.042004163,0,0,0,0,0,0.225056563,0.074945164,0.244433269,0,0,0,0,0.101658052,0,0,0,5.063404514,0.858542083

(2020),2020,Reconstructing quantum molecular rotor ground states,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035108,"Nanomolecular assemblies of C-60 can be synthesized to enclose dipolar molecules. The low-temperature states of such endofullerenes are described by quantum mechanical rotors, which are candidates for quantum information devices with higher-dimensional local Hilbert spaces. The experimental exploration of endofullerene arrays comes at a time when machine learning techniques are rapidly being adopted to characterize, verify, and reconstruct quantum states from measurement data. In this paper, we develop a strategy for reconstructing the ground state of chains of dipolar rotors using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) adapted to train on data from higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate accurate generation of energy expectation values from an RBM trained on data in the free-rotor eigenstate basis and explore the learning resources required for various chain lengths and dipolar interaction strengths. Finally, we show evidence for fundamental limitations in the accuracy achievable by RBMs due to the difficulty in imposing symmetries in the sampling procedure. We discuss possible avenues to overcome this limitation in the future, including the further development of autoregressive models such as recurrent neural networks for the purposes of quantum state reconstruction.",,Conference Paper,5,0.836505294,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.132641218,0,0,0,0,0,0.177596605,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.112127415,0.14350607,0,0,0.157893191,0,0,0,0,0.157390536,0,0,0.046022042,0.12365017,0,0,0,0,0,0.151572006,0,0.107168531,0,0,0.327240234,0.312787475,0.163083849,0,0.161494334,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.121288614,0,0,0,0,0,0.55467646,0,0.164702532,0,0,0,0,0.11834236,0.043092871,0,0.119639674,0,0.120625334,0,0.174482358,0,0,0,0.163620117,0,0.327240234,0,4.181884229,0.613386959

(2019),2019,Fault Prognosis of Hydraulic Pump Based on Bispectrum Entropy and Deep Belief Network,MEASUREMENT SCIENCE REVIEW,10.2478/msr-2019-0025,"Fault prognosis plays a key role in the framework of Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM). Limited by the inherent disadvantages, most traditional intelligent algorithms perform not very well in fault prognosis of hydraulic pumps. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a novel methodology for fault prognosis of hydraulic pump based on the bispectrum entropy and the deep belief network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the bispectrum features of vibration signals are analyzed, and a bispectrum entropy method based on energy distribution is proposed to extract the effective feature for prognostics. Then, the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model based on the Restrict Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is proposed as the prognostics model. For the purpose of accurately predicting the trends and the random fluctuations during the performance degradation of the hydraulic pump, the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) is introduced to search for the optimal value of initial parameters of the network. Finally, analysis of the hydraulic pump degradation experiment demonstrates that the proposed algorithm has a satisfactory prognostics performance and is feasible to meet the requirements of CBM.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.064051,Journal,1,0.834097028,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.223958203,0.20076749,0,0,0,0,0.179031001,0,0,0.312424194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.140302217,0,0,0,0,0.114031418,0,0,0.183381599,0,0.151349643,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.181729965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.195691555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.359131081,0.343874615,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.367416234,0,0,0,0,0.151765396,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.084594081,0.158197242,0.296157645,0.215684106,0,0,0,0,0,0.218325391,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.077813077,0.58444426

With the advent of quantum computers, all encrypted communications based on traditional asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC) will become insecure. The definition the PQC standards is an on going process proceeding at a fast pace, involving new and largely unexplored cryptographic primitives. For this reason, the design of hardware implementations of PQC algorithms is still under study. In this paper, we introduce the fundamentals of PQC, with a focus on lattice-based cryptography and its hardware security issues, namely side-channel and fault-based attacks. Then, we focus on isogeny-based cryptography and the SIKE algorithm. We highlight the importance of fault-tolerant design choices through the presentation of a fault attack, based on the electromagnetic injection of transient faults, targeting this cryptographic primitive. Finally, we show an interesting idea that starts from the observation that some PQC algorithms have an intrinsic probabilistic behavior. We argue that this characteristic is a clear opportunity that paves the way for the application of approximate (or inexact) computing to the implementation of PQC cryptography.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.034018,Journal,3,0.804940104,0,0.117863251,0.765324046,0,0,0,0,0,0.223140504,0,0.047805714,0.335500806,0,0,0,0,0,0.20752233,0.125201311,0,0.039678992,0,0.112983743,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038250647,0,0,0,0.15668869,0.126368223,0,0,0,0,0,0.139189062,0,0,0,0.142533197,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.090260137,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.112681706,0,0,0,0.117168275,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.108995077,0.099437025,0.060212894,0,0,0.145018839,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.311824472,0.371419063

(2020),2020,Compact and high-performance vortex mode sorter for multi-dimensional multiplexed fiber communication systems,OPTICA,10.1364/OPTICA.385590,"With the amplitude, time, wavelength/frequency, phase, and polarization/spin parameter dimensions of the light wave/photon almost fully utilized in both classical and quantum photonic information systems, orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by optical vortex modes is regarded as a new modal parameter dimension for further boosting the capacity and performance of the systems. To exploit the OAM mode space for such systems, stringent performance requirements on a pair of OAM mode multiplexer and demultiplexer (also known as mode sorters) must be met. In this work, we implement a newly discovered optical spiral transformation to achieve a low-cross-talk, wide-optical-bandwidth, polarization-insensitive, compact, and robust OAM mode sorter that realizes the desired bidirectional conversion between seven co-axial OAM modes carried by a ring-core fiber and seven linearly displaced Gaussian-like modes in parallel single-mode fiber channels. We further apply the device to successfully demonstrate high-spectral-efficiency and high-capacity data transmission in a 50-km OAM fiber communication link for the first time, in which a multi-dimensional multiplexing scheme multiplexes eight orbital-spin vortex mode channels with each mode channel simultaneously carrying 10 wavelength-division multiplexing channels, demonstrating the promising potential of both the OAM mode sorter and the multi-dimensional multiplexed OAM fiber systems enabled by the device.

Military forces all over the world have come to value the new role of cyberspace in warfare, building up cyber commands. and establishing new capabilities. Integral to such capabilities is that military forces fundamentally depend on the rapid exchange of information in order for their decision-making processes to gain superiority on the battlefield: this compounds the need to develop network-enabled capabilities to realize network-centric warfare. This triangle of cyber offense, cyber defence, and cyber dependence creates a challenging and complex system of interdependencies. Alongside, while numerous technologies have not improved cyber security significantly, this may change with upcoming new concepts and systems, like decentralized ledger technologies (Blockchains) or quantum-secured communication. Following these thoughts, the paper analyses the development of both cyber threats and defence capabilities during the past 10 years, evaluates the current situation and gives recommendations for improvements. To this end, the paper is structured as follows: first, general conditions for military forces with respect to cyber are described, including an analysis of the most likely courses of action of the West and their seemingly traditional adversary in the East, Russia. The overview includes a discussion of the usefulness of the measures and an overview of upcoming technologies critical for cyber security.

This has also contributed to an ever-growing challenge whether the literature is current, as there can be a gap between when the patent was filed and when it was approved. Moreover, it is difficult to ensure that a patent cites the appropriate prior art due to variety and volume of materials science data, especially when it is in two separate sources that have different curation mechanisms and purpose - publications and patents. The existing relational database schema, generally used to store publications, also presents challenges given the strict tabular schema, which may not be appropriate for organizing and querying highly interconnected information about materials in these publications and patents. For example, elements are chemically combined to form a compound, which can then be converted to other compounds via chemical reactions. Furthermore, relational database is not designed for handling combining data from multiple sources and with various formats, thus it makes discover relevance between publications and patents become difficult. In order to explore an alternative approach to represent materials data and combine data from multiple sources into the same repository, in this work, we propose a solution to integrate data from Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and patent data from USPTO1 database into a network and named it heterogeneous materials information network (HMIN). We generalize prior work which based on using meta path-based topological features to explore the network, and we propose features to identify network noise and investigate relatedness between different-typed objects to meet our application needs. We built several machine learning models by using these features to explore relevance between materials science publications and patents. Experiment results show that HMIN can help researchers effectively discover related publications and patents originally kept in different sources.

Additionally, our proposed technique also enhances data transmission rate through exploiting the notion of Superdense Coding. Such simultaneous improvement in both security level and data transmission rate, which we achieve through our proposed technique, is a rare trait for currently available encryption technique. We name our proposed technique SuperCrypt. We elaborate implementation issues pertinent for SuperCrypt such as recycling qubits and re-establishing entanglement. We also implement SuperCrypt in a discrete-event network simulator ns-2 and evaluate the performance of SuperCrypt through analyzing the simulation results.

A research contribution focusing on the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)-enabled solutions assisting in the security framework of an optical 5G fronthaul segment is presented. We thoroughly investigate the integration of a BB84-QKD link, operating at telecom band, delivering quantum keys for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption engines of a packetized fronthaul layer interconnecting multiple 5G terminal nodes. Secure Key Rate calculations are studied for both dedicated and shared fiber configurations to identify the attack surface of AES-encrypted data links in each deployment scenario. We also propose a converged fiber-wireless scenario, exploiting a mesh networking extension operated by mmWave wireless links. In addition to the quantum layer performance, emphasis is placed on the strict requirements of 5G-oriented optical edge segments, such as the latency and the availability of quantum keys. We find that for the dark fiber case, secret keys can be distilled at fiber lengths much longer than the maximum fiber fronthaul distance corresponding to the round-trip latency barrier, for both P2P and P2MP topologies. On the contrary, the inelastic Raman scattering makes the simultaneous transmission of quantum and classical signals much more challenging. To counteract the contamination of noise photons, a resilient classical/QKD coexistence scheme is adopted. Motivated by the recent advancements in quantum technology roadmap, our analysis aims to introduce the QKD blocks as a pillar of the quantum-safe security framework of the 5G/B5G-oriented fronthaul infrastructure.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.405020,Journal,4,0.834466279,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.111446774,0.03995156,0.093460101,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.104631587,0.177608353,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.126598521,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.031966326,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.35132044,0,0,0,0.11327597,0,0,0,0.201757947,0.294624101,0,0.063628689,0.112905737,0,0,0,0,0.07543101,0,0,0,0.050988527,0,0.066329888,0.096489972,0.10527999,0.084245531,0.064292907,0.094271683,0.235422168,0,0,0,0.097918324,0,0.121451431,0,0.281750916,0,0,0.029931761,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.629729584,0,0.115932205,0,0.117902585,4.090544587,0.587984955
969,2,C2,Damgard et al. (2015),2015,On the Orthogonal Vector Problem and the Feasibility of Unconditionally Secure Leakage-Resilient Computation,INFORMATION THEORETIC SECURITY (ICITS 2015),10.1007/978-3-319-17470-9_6,"We consider unconditionally secure leakage resilient two-party computation. Security means that the leakage obtained by an adversary can be simulated using a similar amount of leakage from the private inputs or outputs. A related problem is known as circuit compilation, where there is only one device doing a computation on public input and output. Here the goal is to ensure that the adversary learns only the input/output behaviour of the computation, even given leakage from the internal state of the device. We study these problems in an enhanced version of the only computation leaks model, where the adversary is additionally allowed a bounded amount of global leakage from the state of the entity under attack. In this model, we show the first unconditionally secure leakage resilient two-party computation protocol. The protocol assumes access to correlated randomness in the form of a functionality f(ORT) that outputs pairs of orthogonal vectors (u, v) over some finite field, where the adversary can leak independently from u and from v. We also construct a general circuit compiler secure in the same leakage model. Our constructions work, even if the adversary is allowed to corrupt a constant fraction of the calls to f(ORT) and decide which vectors should be output. On the negative side, we show that unconditionally secure two-party computation and circuit compilation are in general impossible in the plain version of our model. It follows that even a somewhat unreliable version of f(ORT) cannot be implemented with unconditional security in the plain leakage model, using classical communication. However, we show that an implementation using quantum communication does exist. In particular, we propose a simple prepare-and-measure type protocol which we show secure using a new result on sampling from a quantum population. Although the protocol may produce a small number of incorrect pairs, this is sufficient for leakage resilient computation by our other results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantum protocol is used constructively for leakage resilience.

Millimeter-Wave systems have a high available bandwidth and the potential to accommodate numerous antennas in a small area, which makes them an attractive candidate for future networks employing spatial modulation and space-time shift keying (STSK). Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems are capable of achieving an increased throughput, by allowing multiple users to share the same resources at the cost of a higher transmission power, or an increased detection (preprocessing) complexity at the receiver (transmitter) of an uplink (downlink) scenario. In this paper, we propose the new concept of joint-alphabet space time shift keying. As an application scenario, we employ it in the context of the uplink of NOMA mm-Wave systems. We demonstrate with the aid of extrinsic information transfer charts that a higher capacity is achievable when compared with STSK, while retaining the attractive flexibility of STSK in terms of its diversity gain and coding rate.

With the growing popularity of the use of fiber optic communication systems, there is a need to protect transmission lines against unauthorized interference and data interception. Classical Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) allows to transfer quantum key and interrupt transmission when it detects interference. The use of proven as safe protocols BB84 in conjunction with currently used encryption techniques provide better data safety. However, due to lack of evidence on the safety of transmission using commercial QKD systems, their apply to the protection of classified information is currently impossible. Support these assumptions are carried out so far successful attacks on QKD systems. These statements do not mean impossibility of implementing these systems for the protection of classified information in the future. Our team proposes a solution consisting in transmitting information in fiber optic track with simultaneous implementation of a single photon sensor, developmentally impaired with the location of the interference place. The greatest yield of this method is to detect the intruder, who is unaware of its detection. To optimize and accelerate the testing, a simulation program that allows you to adjust the operating parameters of the sensor system and verification of performance of laboratory systems has been developed.

It is known that the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC convertibility is characterized by the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state, i.e. the largest Schmidt rank over those bipartite states lying in the support of the reduced density operator. In this paper, we further study this problem and exhibit novel results in both multi-copy and asymptotic settings, utilizing powerful results from the structure of matrix spaces. In the multi-copy regime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of two tripartite pure states can be strictly larger than the product of their maximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full characterization of those tripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative when taking tensor product with itself. Notice that such tripartite states admit strict advantages in tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC transformation when multiple copies are provided. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on determining the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC entanglement transformation rate. Computing this rate turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic maximal Schmidt rank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal Schmidt rank. Despite the difficulty caused by the super-multiplicative property, we provide explicit formulas for evaluating the asymptotic maximal Schmidt ranks of two important families of tripartite pure states by resorting to certain results of the structure of matrix spaces, including the study of matrix semi-invariants. These formulas turn out to be powerful enough to give a sufficient and necessary condition to determine whether a given tripartite pure state can be transformed to the bipartite maximally entangled state under SLOCC, in the asymptotic setting. Applying the recent progress on the non-commutative rank problem, we can verify this condition in deterministic polynomial time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-1056/ab5efd,Journal,6,0.808665514,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.153260442,0.057228353,0,0.08147729,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.302138674,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.091129398,0,0.090847404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.261149138,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.186882367,0,0,0.231836958,0.102786635,0,0,0,0.171710639,0.166524777,0.090847404,0,0.166437431,0,0,0,0,0.664910598,0.253484794,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.072298961,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.294205968,0,3.43915723,0.406830929
977,5,C2,Rao et al. (2018),2018,Future Indian Space: Perspectives of Game Changers,NEW SPACE,10.1089/space.2017.0013,"In the past 50 years, Indian Space has seen many successful milestones, demonstrating excelling Indian technology and widespread utilization of space services in different areas of the national economy. Present capabilities and capacities of Indian Space are mainly in the unitary capabilities of the national space agencythis has enabled the nation to significantly achieve about 10-12 high-quality missions every year. Meeting future domestic needs and benefiting by access to a large global market of space will require a quantum jump in capabilities and capacities to be served. Another important development is the aspirational growth of the Indian economy and the people. With agross domestic product (GDP) growth hovering around 7%-8% and a few trillion dollar economy, the nation has launched important developmental initiativesDigital India, Make in India, Smart City, Swach Bharat, National Education Mission, and National Skill Mission programs. Thus, demands for diverse applications of space technology are inevitable, integrating across geographical, sectoral, and temporal domains of the country. In an earlier suo-moto study, we have outlined the future 10-20 years of policy perspectives for Indian Space development and also outlined the perspectives of how a national space ecosystem would emerge, evolving from the present national space agency into a public-private-academia triad. Looking ahead into such a national ecosystem, we now visualize critical developments that will bring impacting and paradigm shifts to holistic Indian Space through the triadgame changers. With about 100-150 possible missions in the coming 10-20 yearsencompassing earth observation, satellite communications, positioning, space science, planetary missions, operational and advanced launch access missions, and the initiation of a human spaceflight programthe critical shifts would be not just technological advancements but also organizational restructuring from emerging newer organizational arrangements, industrialization and emergence of private space industry, deeper penetration of space services in Indian society, increasing global presence of Indian players, and a vibrant cooperative and collaboration at the international level. What will drive these game changers? Cost efficiency will be one key driver amply demonstrated in many sectors for global markets; this will impact global space markets and bring a leveling effect across global markets. Indian skills and human resources will be another driver, with Indian scientists, engineers, and managers playing a major role in the national and global space. Third will be Indian innovationthe ability to improvise and innovate with simple low-cost, but effective, solutions. These three drivers will bring a new economic model that balances systems, costs, and performance. The article provides a perspective of future Indian Space and outlines game changer impacts that will emerge for space activities in India. The article also discusses how, in an integrated manner, Indian Space can and should reach greater heights by key policy, strategy, and actions for the coming few decades.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ab520e,Journal,5,0.760327518,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.040531365,0,0,0.017575984,0,0,0.081402669,0.087441628,0,0.031560697,0,0,0,0.014588158,0,0,0,0.068525866,0,0.044379923,0,0.048247646,0,0.034262933,0,0,0,0,0,0.056252082,0,0,0,0,0.092919679,0,0,0.048713759,0,0.103038149,0.051173478,0,0,0.049833763,0.104805928,0,0,0.044379923,0,0,0.027992318,0,0,0,0,0,0.066369082,0,0,0,0,0,0.029180663,0,0,0.037062334,0,0,0,0.053316821,0,0,0.043077437,0,0.080145619,0,0.041317113,0,0.036162043,0,0,0,0.022137538,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049997631,0.051002326,0.949954988,0,2.507349543,0.147690631

(2019),2019,Crypto Accelerators for Power-Efficient and Real-Time on-Chip Implementation of Secure Algorithms,"2019 26TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS (ICECS)",,"The demand for data exchange is ever growing. Internet of Things (IoT), industry 4.0, smart city and next-generation interconnected vehicles are some examples of scenarios in which a high volume of nodes share data across networks. Hence, the data protection plays a fundamental aspect to avoid disclosure or manipulation of sensitive information and disruption of services, particularly in safety critical applications. On the other hand, also the compute power at disposal of possible attackers and hackers is growing, and next-future post-quantum capabilities will require the usage of longer keys, certificates and digital signatures, to preserve the security level offered by cryptographic functions. This will affect not only the amount of exchange data, but also the computational resources to secure data, increasing processing time, latencies and power consumption, and lowering data rates. In this work, we investigate different implementation strategies to overcome such performance limitations. This work provides a comparison among pure software approach (both on 32b and 64b processors) and hardware-based solutions we developed for FPGA and ASIC System-on- Chip platforms, for the most common symmetric-key and public-key cryptographic algorithms. The proposed hardware accelerators feature one order of magnitude higher throughput (and lower latency) and more than two orders lower power consumption than their software counterparts. A highly configurable cryptographic suite is proposed that can be customized according to the application requirements and thus able to increase as much as possible the efficiency in terms of energy per enciphered bits per second.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00220-017-3077-5,Journal,1,0.859532237,0,0,0,0,0.126073524,0,0,0,0.15677279,0,0.100761203,0,0,0.077778776,0,0,0.180934044,0.043739959,0,0,0,0,0.119069216,0,0,0,0.127212638,0,0,0,0.196425671,0,0,0,0,0.150727097,0.040310884,0.108305662,0,0,0.165128177,0,0,0,0.279270688,0.09386933,0,0,0,0.136985879,0,0,0,0.146195397,0,0,0,0.080238459,0,0,0,0.546212003,0,0,0,0,0,0.128597362,0,0.083644784,0.121677921,0,0.21247433,0,0,0.178126366,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.136122534,0.17764989,0,0,0.037745212,0.114865715,0,0.06345605,0.211312392,0.229731429,0,0.146195397,0,0,0.143315492,0.146195397,0,0,5.00712167,0.842889548
