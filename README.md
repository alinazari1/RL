# Topic Modeling and Reinforcement Learning

This repository demonstrates the application of topic modeling and reinforcement learning for improving the discovery of novel insights in a given domain.

## Phases

1. **Data Collection**: Define search keywords and build a corpus.
2. **Applying the Method**: Perform topic modeling and refine it using aspect-based keywords.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Use RL to improve the topic model by adjusting states based on rewards.
4. **Analysis**: Analyze and fine-tune the topic models.

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- gensim
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to initiate the topic modeling and RL process.

```bash
python main.py
